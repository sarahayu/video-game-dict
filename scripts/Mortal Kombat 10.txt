JOHNNY: Millions of years ago, Shinnok, one of the Elder Gods, turned on his fellow deities and invaded the Earthrealm.
JOHNNY: Raiden and the Elder Gods stopped Shinnok. Locked him up in the Netherrealm.
JOHNNY: Others followed in Shinnok's footsteps, like Outworld's emperor Shao Kahn, who was obsessed with conquering Earthrealm.
JOHNNY: So Raiden convinced the Elder Gods to inact the Mortal Kombat tournament as a way to even the odds... give Earthrealm a chance.
JOHNNY: For generations, Shao Kahn followed the Elder Gods' rules. The war moved to the arena, where he sent his toughest fighters to challenge Raiden's greatest defenders in Mortal Kombat.
JOHNNY: Two years ago, we beat him.
JOHNNY: But Shao Kahn wasn't ready to lose.
JOHNNY: He violated the rules of Mortal Kombat and invaded Earthrealm.
JOHNNY: Most of Earth's defenders - our friends - were killed. Turned into evil undead warriors.
JOHNNY: Despite the odds, we stopped Shao Kahn's invasion. As punishment, the Elder Gods destroyed him.
JOHNNY: We thought the long nightmare was over. But it turns out that Shinnok had been manipulating events.
JOHNNY: Shao Kahn's invasion, his death... all part of Shinnok's plan to escape the Netherrealm and resume his war on the Elder Gods.
PILOT: Destination dead ahead.
JOHNNY: Set 'er down nice and easy for me.
PILOT: Don't I always?
JOHNNY: If by "always" you mean "not once".
JOHNNY: Major?
SONYA: Alright, you have the rendezvous coordinates. Far edge of the forest. From there, we access the portal to Raiden's sky temple.
JOHNNY: Where there's an angry former Elder God and his devils waiting for us.
SOLDIER: Gods, portals, flying demons...
JOHNNY: Blind guys with magic swords...
KENSHI: The world has changed. For the worse if we do not expel Shinnok from Raiden's temple. He means to poison Earthrealm's life force - the Jinsei.
SONYA: And we're not gonna let that happen.
JOHNNY: Kenshi and I appreciate the Major allowing us to join you. We're happy to help kick Shinnok's bony ass back to the Netherrealm.
JOHNNY: You gotta land this thing!
JOHNNY: Shit!
SCORPION: GET OVER HERE!
JOHNNY: Damn, I'm good!
JOHNNY: Eugh, nasty!
JOHNNY: Bring it!
JOHNNY: No!
SCORPION: The end is near.
JOHNNY: Getting a little ahead of yourself, aren't ya?
JOHNNY: Gotta get back to the chopper.
JOHNNY: Sonya! Get outta there--
JOHNNY: Whoo! THAT was unpleasently cold!
JOHNNY: I liked it better when we fought on the same side.
JOHNNY: You okay?
KENSHI: We fared better than the men.
JOHNNY: Add 'em to the list of things Shinnok'll answer for.
FUJIN: Raiden! We must re-fortify the portal's defenses below!
RAIDEN: No, Fujin. It is too late.
QUAN CHI: The mighty gods of Earthrealm.
RAIDEN: You befoul these hallowed grounds, Quan Chi! Begone!
QUAN CHI: Surely you are pleased to see your friends...
QUAN CHI: You abandoned them to their deaths. I returned them to life.
RAIDEN: A life worse than death!
QUAN CHI: One you will soon share, and my lord himself shall witness your fall.
JAX: So he's done his job?
SMOKE: I expect him soon.
JOHNNY: Jax...
KENSHI: Nightwolf!
JAX: There!
JOHNNY: Smoke...
SMOKE: Smoke is dead. I am Enenra.
JAX: This is your last mission, Sonya.
JOHNNY: The real Jax wouldn't punch his best friend!
JAX: Johnny Cage. Killing you will be a pleasure.
JOHNNY: We're gonna fix you someday...
JOHNNY: Well, nice seeing them again.
JOHNNY: Sonya... that's not him.
JOHNNY: That the elevator?
KENSHI: Yes. The elevator. 
KENSHI: Sento contains the souls of my ancestors. They guide me.
JOHNNY: Could they hurry the hell up?
JOHNNY: Goin' up!
SONYA: Fall back. Now!
JOHNNY: Go on.
JOHNNY: You guys stay here. Close the door.
SHINNOK: You see it now, Raiden... Your legacy. You poison their hearts with hope.
RAIDEN: And what do you offer? The same as you did millenia ago, when you betrayed your fellow Elder Gods and attacked Earthrealm! We stopped you then, imprisoned you in the Netherrealm! We will do so again!
SHINNOK: Remove the shadow from the light, the shadow grows. The legacy of life is death, Raiden. My followers accept this and live on. They fight for me.
FUJIN: You'll not touch the Jinsei!
SHINNOK: Oh, I will, and all of Earthrealm will learn the truth... of death!
JOHNNY: Oh, sorry ma'am! Didn't see ya there!
SHINNOK: Miserable wretch! Insignificant speck of feculant scum! How DARE you!
SHINNOK: That is mine!
SONYA: Ready?
JOHNNY: As always.
SHINNOK: She will be the first to join me.
JOHNNY: No!
JOHNNY: I'm not sure what just happened to me...
JOHNNY: ...but I am sure of this: You don't even THINK of hurting her!
JOHNNY: You really are a fallen Elder God.
RAIDEN: Johnny Cage! The amulet!
SHINNOK: No!
SHINNOK: NO!
JOHNNY: Enjoy the new digs, Gramps.
JOHNNY: Sonya?
SONYA: Johnny... did we...?
JOHNNY: Yeah. We got 'im.
RAIDEN: Remain here. The chamber's properties will heal Sonya Blade in short order.
FUJIN: We can deal with Quan Chi later, Kenshi.
RAIDEN: We've netted a bigger prize this day.
KENSHI: Shinnok's Amulet...
KENSHI: ...and within it...
JOHNNY: Ol' Fishface himself.
FUJIN: Let us take the amulet to the Elder Gods.
RAIDEN: They cannot destroy it. No one can.
FUJIN: They might offer counsel. Shinnok can never escape.
KENSHI: The war is not over. Quan Chi has escaped. Why are you smiling?
JOHNNY: She called me "Johnny".
JOHNNY: Raiden told me later that I'm descended from some Mediterranean war cult.
JOHNNY: "Bred as warriors for the gods." I've never been able to re-summon that green halo. Raiden thinks it was triggered when I saw a loved one about to die.
KUNG JIN: How 'bout you, Cassie? Can you summon anything like that? Or did it skip a generation?
TAKEDA: Take it easy, Jin.
CASSIE: We didn't need a halo in Darfur - or Iran, or Kurdistan. Did we, Jacqui?
JACQUI: Nope, we didn't. Shaolin monks ever send you there, Jin?
KUNG JIN: I've seen plenty of action; Takeda and I both. Stuff that'd blow your Special Forces minds--
CASSIE: Fu--
JOHNNY: At ease. You're all here because you deserve to be. You're beautiful and unique snowflakes. 
JOHNNY: Now, as I'm sure you're unaware - judging from the lack of gift cards - today is our team's six week anniversary. Secretary Blake says he's pleased with our progress.
KUNG JIN: You could spit in his hair and he'd be "pleased with our progress".
JACQUI: He was smart enough to have Mister Cage put this team together.
TAKEDA: I'm glad the Shirai Ryu chose me to join. New places...
TAKEDA: ...new faces.
JOHNNY: As the secretary pointed out, us older folks are gonna retire someday, so it's time for your generation to step up. Shaolin, Shirai Ryu, S-F. Together. For your team's first mission, you're going to the Lin Kuei Temple.
JOHNNY: We haven't heard from the Grandmaster in a while, so we need to make sure he's still on our side; that he's got our backs if things flare up again with Outworld. You need to bring him in, but don't be surprised if Sub-Zero's not willing to cooperate.
CASSIE: Why be worried about Outworld? I thought Kotal Kahn respected the Reiko Accords?
JOHNNY: He does, but he's facing a civil war. The rebels win, those accords will be history.
KOTAL: Twenty million.
KANO: Emperor, what's the expression? "S' not worth the dirt on my shoe"?
D'VORAH: Kotal Kahn has always bargained with you fairly, Kano.
KANO: Sure, sure. I'm just sayin'; upgraded weapons, my intel - and poof! The long Outworld civil war - done. Might be nice to kick back a bit, eh?
KOTAL: You know Mileena's location.
KANO: And 'er whole rebel army. S'gotta be worth at least fifty.
KOTAL: I must attack her. Immediately. End this conflict. As you say...
KOTAL: ...it drains us.
KANO: Right. Do we have a deal?
KOTAL: What is it, D'Vorah?
D'VORAH: The emperor should not be concerned. Accident ahead. This One will clear it.
D'VORAH: Make way for Kotal Kahn! Move!
TANYA: The Tarkatans are in position. We await your order.
MILEENA: It is given, dearest Tanya.
RAIN: Stopping a carriage is nothing. Killing an emperor--
MILEENA: FALSE emperor!
RAIN: --requires power. Power you have, Mileena. And won't use.
MILEENA: It pains me to use it, Rain. I need more time. The usurper's excursion came too soon.
RAIN: The rain falls when it may.
MILEENA: No matter - if Kano does what I paid him to do.
D'VORAH: Now! Do it!
KANO: You said a mouthful...
KOTAL: You wound me, Kano. Your offer of aid was but wind and air?!
KANO: Keep yer fifty million. Mileena's giving me twice that to take you out!
KOTAL: You're not worth the dirt on my shoe.
KOTAL: You are the Edenian, Tanya.
TANYA: I'm pleased you remember me, Ko'atal.
KOTAL: I will never forget those who freed Mileena.
TANYA: She vowed to create a free Edenia - something you refuse to do.
KOTAL: A united Outworld stands strong against it's enemies.
TANYA: It will never be united under your rule.
KOTAL: Your rebellion is all that prevents it.
KOTAL: You are a fool to trust Mileena.
KOTAL: She tasks me... for the last time.
KOTAL: Mileena.
MILEENA: Kano was to kill you, miserable snake!
KOTAL: Another Edenian. The supposed half-god.
RAIN: I am a son of Argus. I was not merely declared a god by befuddled commoners, Buluc.
KOTAL: Surely Mileena suspects your true intentions, son of Argus. He charges at Rain, who disappears in a flash of water. The Kahn stops short of the rooftop edge, but is unaware that Rain teleported behind him. Rain leaps in the air and dropkicks Kotal in the back, sending him off the rooftop to the street below. He lands hard on his front. As he struggles to his feet, Rain teleports to the street to meet him in kombat.
RAIN: My "intentions" are to teach you the difference between pretension and godhood.
KOTAL: That should silence you.
ERRON: You won't touch him again.
MILEENA: But I will.
MILEENA: As the heir to my father Shao Kahn, I, Mileena, Kahnum of Outworld, order your execution!
KOTAL: There will be an execution this day.
KOTAL: You will atone for your dissent, Mileena. Your blood will make right. 
KOTAL: Up the stair path... to the fire's edge!
D'VORAH: What did my emperor see?
KOTAL: A mere cub... grown to be a jaguar.
CASSIE: Once we hit the drop-point, we split up.
CASSIE: Jacqui and I will come in from the south. You two from the west.
JACQUI: Rendezvous here. The north entrance.
JIN: Then what? A simple pick up and go?
CASSIE: We bag 'im if he resists.
TAKEDA: Resistance might be more possible than you think.
CASSIE: Don't sweat it. It comes to that, Sub-Zero won't know what hit him.
LIN KUEI #1: The forward defenses stand down as you command, Grandmaster.
LIN KUEI #2: It is confirmed. Four intruders.
SUB-ZERO: It is time to entertain our guests.
CASSIE: All right, I've got point. You and Jin, that side.
CASSIE: Move!
CASSIE: Ready?
CASSIE: Dammit, Jin!
KUNG JIN: You. I need to s--
SUB-ZERO: You are not welcome here. State your intentions.
CASSIE: Grandmaster. We need you to come with us. My name is Sergeant--
SUB-ZERO: You demand my cooperation. Yet you are cut off. Surrounded. What will you do?
CASSIE: My father always spoke highly of you, Sub-Zero. He wants to talk.
SUB-ZERO: Talking. Always his first choice.
KUNG JIN: Okay, let's try pummeling. Now!
CASSIE: Wait!
SUB-ZERO: Cassandra Cage. You lead this group, but they do not follow. What would your mother do?
CASSIE: Stop wasting time and take you down.
SUB-ZERO: You are more like your mother than you think.
SUB-ZERO: Your powers should have revealed my intention, Takahashi Takeda. No doubt Kenshi taught you how to use them.
TAKEDA: My father taught me a lot, Grandmaster.
SUB-ZERO: Let us see.
SUB-ZERO: You are not your father. Not yet.
JACQUI: Dammit.
SUB-ZERO: You announced your arrival, Jacqueline Briggs.
JACQUI: Specialist Briggs.
SUB-ZERO: Yes. Military decorum is important to your family.
JACQUI: If you know my father, you know me. Thought you and he were friends.
SUB-ZERO: Our histories share a dark chapter.
SUB-ZERO: Do not judge yourself harshly, Specialist Briggs.
KUNG JIN: A feint. Bravo.
SUB-ZERO: Kung Jin. You should rally your companions rather than mock your superiors.
KUNG JIN: I'll remember that - in case I ever meet one.
SUB-ZERO: False bravado does not suit you.
TAKEDA: Any ideas?
CASSIE: Sub Zero, let's talk.
SUB-ZERO: That opportunity has passed.
KUNG JIN: Got a new plan, Cage?
JACQUI: You could'a followed the old one, Jin.
CASSIE: You're gonna catch hell if you kill us.
SUB-ZERO: ...Yes. I suppose so.
CASSIE: That worked?
JACQUI: This was all a... a--
SUB-ZERO: A training exercise.
CASSIE: Damn. I shoulda seen it.
SUB-ZERO: You and your friends show much promise, Cassandra Cage. But until you function as one, you will fall short.
JOHNNY: So other than that you enjoyed your visit.
CASSIE: The Lin Kuei shredded us.
KUNG JIN: You, maybe.
JACQUI: I see plenty of frozen bootprints on your ass, too.
JOHNNY: C'mon now, you're all winners in my book.
JOHNNY: New orders. From General Blade.
JOHNNY: Priority One: Outworlders. Here in Earthrealm...
TAKEDA: An invasion?
JACQUI: Couldn't be.
KUNG JIN: You're not afraid are you, Mister Cage?
JOHNNY: Outworlders, I can handle...
JOHNNY: So when did they show up?
KENSHI: The portal opened by the docks a few hours ago. Nearly five thousand in all. Refugees from the Outworld civil war.
JOHNNY: Must be bad if they risked coming to Earthrealm.
KENSHI: After you.
KENSHI: Do not dwell on your encounter with the Lin Kuei, son.
TAKEDA: Kinda hard not to.
SONYA: Thanks, Kenshi. Could you and Mister Cage join us?
SONYA: Sergeant Cage, you and your team as you were.
RAIDEN: This is Li Mei. She seeks asylum for her people in Earthrealm.
LI MEI: Our village, Sun Do, was the epicentre of a fierce battle. We barely escaped with our lives.
JOHNNY: Such is war.
JOHNNY: I mean, no offense, but... you Outworlders kinda live for that, right?
LI MEI: This was different. The rebels, Mileena, had a weapon unlike anything... Entire battalions, erased. It was not honourable. Not kombat.
RAIDEN: Tell me more about the weapon.
LI MEI: A talisman. Gold, with a centre jewel. Mileena wields it's crimson energy without precision.
CASSIE: Well, that's good then--
SONYA: Not now, Sergeant Cage.
LI MEI: It is enough that she possesses it. It turns the tide in her favor. The emperor grows desperate. And those caught in the middle... pay the price.
RAIDEN: If this talisman is what I suspect it to be, we may all pay a price.
KUNG JIN: We talking about Shinnok's Amulet?
SONYA: Can't be. The base, the vault, your wardings? S-F, Shaolin, no way anyone can get past all that.
RAIDEN: I must be certain.
JOHNNY: Well, this is cozy.
LI MEI: You remind me of an Earthrealmer who crossed over with us. He also found humour in everything.
JOHNNY: Handsome guy, right?
LI MEI: He was an Earthrealmer. One of his eyes... glowed red.
KUNG JIN: Who does she mean?
SONYA: Kenshi, continue with Li Mei. I'm going to the refugee camp. Gotta get to him before he finds a way out.
JOHNNY: I'll come with.
SONYA: Go get an update on camp security from Colonel Flagg.
JOHNNY: Why?
SONYA: Because then you won't be here.
CASSIE: Are we with you?
SONYA: No. I need to confirm with Kotal Kahn that Li Mei's story is true. You and your team are going to Outworld.
JACQUI: I dunno, I expected the sky to be purple or something.
KUNG JIN: Don't believe everything you see online.
CASSIE: And what makes you an expert?
KUNG JIN: The Shaolin archives. I studied a lot about Outworld.
CASSIE: No substitute for experience.
KUNG JIN: So what makes you our leader?
TAKEDA: Guys, let's stick to the mission?
CASSIE: Li Mei has to be telling the truth. 
JACQUI: An invasion would violate the Reiko Accords.
KUNG JIN: 'Cause you can always trust an Outworlder...
TAKEDA: But if Outworld's our ally, why didn't they help us during the Netherrealm war? Against Quan Chi and his team of...
KUNG JIN: Revenants? Like Jacqui's dad?
JACQUI: Asshole!
KUNG JIN: It's not an alliance. Non-agression pact. Outworld is not our ally.
ERRON: A point you might make with more subtlety, given your surroundings. Now state your business. Including a reason why we shouldn't kill you.
TAKEDA: I can read you. You're not from Outworld.
ERRON: I'm from Earthrealm - like you - but my employer, Kotal Kahn is from Outworld. So now I'm from Outworld. State your business.
CASSIE: We're emissaries. We need to talk to Kotal Kahn. 
CASSIE: Here, we have Raiden's official seal.
ERRON: I can buy one of those at that stall right over there.
KUNG JIN: Look, you can arrest us, even kill us, but if we're telling the truth, you probably get a pay cut - or worse. You take us to the Kahn, I'll tell 'im you took us down. Maybe get you a bonus. You can't lose.
ERRON: Follow me.
SOLDIER: "In these times of war, we are required to view every resource as a weapon for our Emperor to use at his discretion." 
SOLDIER: "To take without his leave is to steal from the hand of Kotal Kahn himself."
SOLDIER: "Therefore, having been found guilty of theft, you shall be put to death."
THIEF: I was hungry!
SOLDIER: Your sentence will be carried out... immediately!
KUNG JIN: Death? For petty theft?
ERRON: Remember where you are.
CASSIE: Jin?
KUNG JIN: Get outta here! Go!
ERRON: I knew I shouldn't have listened to you.
KUNG JIN: A lesson in trust... from a mercenary.
ERRON: Here's another learning opportunity.
KUNG JIN: I'm a quick learner.
FERRA: Let's play, Torr!
CASSIE: You couldn't just ask for a pony like every other girl?
KUNG JIN: The archives never mentioned symbiotes.
FERRA: Break her face!
FERRA: Ferra cut you!
FERRA: You here make trouble, Skinny? 
FERRA: Trouble make you!
KUNG JIN: Love to learn more about ya. Too bad you're insane.
KUNG JIN: You guys all right?
D'VORAH: The Earthrealmers, yes? This One must learn more of your diplomatic techniques.
CASSIE: We're here to see Kotal Kahn. General Blade's--
D'VORAH: You interfere with Outworld matters. The penalty is death.
CASSIE: I'm sensing a theme.
D'VORAH: But as we honour the Reiko accords, we will consult the emperor. You will await him here.
CASSIE: You wanna take this opportunity to tell us what the fuckshit you were thinking?!
TAKEDA: I gotta wonder why you'd risk interrealm war for a bread thief.
KUNG JIN: Because not all thieves are irredeemable.
RAIDEN: It has more sentimental than monetary value.
RAIDEN: Nevertheless, I would prefer you did not steal it.
KUNG JIN: It's a family heirloom. One that shouldn't have been given to you!
RAIDEN: Your family honoured me with this memento of your cousin Lao. After his death.
KUNG JIN: A death you caused! You made him fight Shao Kahn, then stood there while that bastard snapped his neck!
RAIDEN: You go too far, Kung Jin.
KUNG JIN: No... Not far enough.
KUNG JIN: Just let me go.
RAIDEN: Blood of Kung Lao, descendant of the Great Kung Lao... a common thief. Did you think you could walk unimpeded into my temple and walk out again... without my complicity?
KUNG JIN: You wanted me to attack you. Why?
RAIDEN: To release your anger. Make you amenable to reason.
KUNG JIN: And make me feel like shit.
RAIDEN: Self-loathing has always been an unfortunate part of your makeup. There lies ahead a brighter path. One that will truly honor your ancestors. 
RAIDEN: One that is worthy of you. Go to the Wu Shi Academy. Join the Shaolin, like Kung Lao before you.
KUNG JIN: I can't. They won't... accept--
RAIDEN: They care only about what is in your heart. Not whom your heart desires.
KUNG JIN: It's too late for me.
RAIDEN: It is never too late, Kung Jin.
KOTAL: Your news of refugees is troubling. Their exodus to Earthrealm was not known to me.
KOTAL: I do know this: I invited no guests from Earthrealm. Certainly none who would disrupt the execution of justice.
KOTAL: How do I know you are not allied with Mileena? Perhaps her newfound power has earned her new friends?
CASSIE: Friends? No. No! We're not even sure that's Shinnok's Amulet that she has--
KOTAL: She employs Shinnok's Amulet against me?! The very item Earthrealm swore would be safe in it's care?! When Outworld was offered no participation--
CASSIE: We were under attack, not Outworld--
KUNG JIN: Kotal Kahn... The Fire that Burns the Sun. We are here because we share your concerns about the missing item. We intend no ill against your rule.
KOTAL: At least one Earthrealmer can forge words like silver. But I recall an Earthrealm expression: "There is more honour among thieves than diplomats."
KUNG JIN: I've had the questionable fortune to be both, Emperor. But I'm telling you the truth.
KOTAL: You are allied with Mileena. You may carry out your sentence.
KUNG JIN: Kotal Kahn, under Outworld law, I claim the right of defense... by kombat.
TAKEDA: What?
JACQUI: You're gonna fight... a duel?
KUNG JIN: To absolve us of all accusations. Denying the request brings dishonour upon the accuser.
KOTAL: You know much of Outworld.
D'VORAH: Know also: The duel ends in death.
KOTAL: You have won nothing. Merely a few more seconds of breath.
KUNG JIN: And now, Emperor?
KOTAL: The charges against you are void. I say to all that Earthrealm means Outworld no harm.
KOTAL: Now kill me. Be done with it.
CASSIE: You're not actually gonna...?
KUNG JIN: Instead of your life, I claim your service. 
KUNG JIN: If Mileena does have the amulet, we can get it from her more easily if we work togther.
D'VORAH: Emperor, they cannot be trusted--
KOTAL: D'Vorah, can you not perceive? I am indebted to them.
KUNG JIN: You honour us, Kotal Kahn. Our gratitude is wide like the ocean.
CASSIE: I'll talk to General Blade. Tell her about our new... arrangement.
SONYA: Thanks for the heads up, Sergeant. Stay with Kotal Kahn. We'll figure out next steps once I've got Kano locked down.
CASSIE: Yes ma'am. Cage out. Sonya stops and looks out to the Outworld refugees.
SONYA: He's still here. I can feel it.
SONYA: Report.
MEDIC: One of the refugees. Found her near the north perimeter.
SONYA: That's one of Kano's "neckties".
SONYA: Inform Li Mei. Tell her we're investigating.
SONYA: Raiden, what'd you find?
RAIDEN: Shinnok's Amulet has been stolen. Replaced by an exquisite duplicate.
SONYA: Damn it.
RAIDEN: Something is wrong. I will speak to you once I--
SONYA: Raiden? Raiden!
SONYA: Lieutenant, I need you to take a team to Fort Charles. Check in with Raiden and report back.
JOHNNY: What's goin' on?
SONYA: What's your update from Colonel Flagg?
JOHNNY: He said, "Why're you bothering me?" and I said, "Because my ex-wife is a pain in the--"
JOHNNY: Where you goin'? You can't just walk away. I'm in this too.
SONYA: Not my decision. Thank your buddy, Secretary Blake.
JOHNNY: THIS is what split us up in the first place. You disappear in your work. Never time for me and Cassie.
SONYA: I had responsibilities. Sorry you couldn't be the centre of attention.
JOHNNY: There was a time when you cared more about your family than your job... General.
JOHNNY: Nope, no evil sorcerers in here.
SONYA: Would you get serious?
JOHNNY: Quan Chi needs to clean up his man-cave.
SONYA: S'cleaner than yours.
JOHNNY: You're comparing me to Quan Chi?
SONYA: Only in terms of cleanliness.
JOHNNY: What's this?
SONYA: I wouldn't do that.
JOHNNY: Ah, come on, where's your sense of--
JOHNNY: ...adventure.
QUAN CHI: You wish for adventure? You shall have it.
SONYA: Fire!
QUAN CHI: I have no need of your soldiers. But you and Mister Cage will serve me well - once you are dead.
SONYA: Dunno when to quit, do ya?
SONYA: Not as tough as you look.
SONYA: Quan Chi, you've lost.
QUAN CHI: A delay, Miss Blade. The inevitable still beckons.
SONYA: Johnny!
JAX: You won't be dead for long.
SONYA: This will not happen!
SONYA: I'm sorry, Jax.
SONYA: I'll get you out of here. You'll be fine.
JOHNNY: Dunno. Blood's... s'posed to be... on the inside...
SONYA: Raiden!
RAIDEN: I must reverse his spell.
SONYA: It's working!
QUAN CHI: You cannot save him.
QUAN CHI: You're weak, Thunder God. Johnny Cage is mine.
SONYA: No. He's MINE. Save him!
SONYA: I've got this son of a bitch!
SONYA: That wasn't even CLOSE to what you deserve.
RAIDEN: Sonya Blade! The link with Quan Chi is not completely severed!
SONYA: Not a problem.
QUAN CHI: No!
RAIDEN: The others are restored to the living. By coupling Quan Chi's dark magicks to my own, I was able to restore their souls.
SONYA: Is he gonna make it?
JOHNNY: Haven't I told you? He's a god.
SONYA: You scared the shit outta me.
JOHNNY: And they said I couldn't do horror films.
SONYA: He's gone?! How did he--?
JOHNNY: We gotta go after him.
SONYA: He can wait. Right now we need to get you and the others back to Earthrealm.
REFUGEE: Why is it taking so long?
SOLDIER: Name?
REFUGEE #2: Re'em Adu Kaire.
SOLDIER: Thanks. All right, second line on your left.
LI MEI: You seem to know this "Kano" intimately.
SONYA: Not the word I'd use, but yes. I chased him for years until he escaped to Outworld after Shinnok's invasion.
KENSHI: Why would he return now?
SONYA: All that matters is he's...
SONYA: ...caught. Gotcha.
KENSHI: Are you lost?
KANO: 'Ello, love! Been a while!
SONYA: Not long enough.
SONYA: This is General Blade. I need MPs to my location immediately.
KANO: Aww, let's keep this between friends. A trade! Info for freedom.
SONYA: I don't negotiate with scumbags.
KANO: Well then, if mother won't play nice, maybe daughter will.
SONYA: If you ever--
KANO: Back off, and all's well. Piss me off, and Cassie's gonna meet Uncle Kano.
SONYA: I swear to God I'll kill you!
SONYA: No. I'm not done with you.
KANO: Alright! Alright! Get off me!
JOHNNY: Sonya, ease up!
KANO: You kill me... never find... amulet!
JOHNNY: Sonya, we need that info.
JOHNNY: Sonya... don't make this another thing you'll regret.
SONYA: Talk!
CASSIE: The Kuatan Jungle?
SONYA: With at least two divisions of Tarkatans. They're on the move constantly to avoid detection.
JACQUI: That's not far. Maybe two hundred kilometres.
SONYA: You know what to do.
CASSIE: Yes ma'am.
SONYA: Good luck. Blade out.
KOTAL: You have new information? From Earthrealm?
CASSIE: Kano talked. Gave us the details on Mileena's location. She has the amulet, but she's got a lot of protection.
KOTAL: We will strike immediately.
D'VORAH: Perhaps a two-pronged approach. The army will engage Mileena - distract her - while This One retrieves the amulet.
CASSIE: Not alone. "This One's" coming with.
D'VORAH: Stealth is of the essence.
CASSIE: Did you not hear me?
D'VORAH: You may assist in the main strike--
KOTAL: D'Vorah. We will grant their request and I will finally be rid of Mileena.
D'VORAH: This One understands your logic, but does not reach the same conclusion.
D'VORAH: Like others, This One is not pleased with Mileena as Kahnum. But it is not clear your coup will succeed.
KOTAL: That is why I invited our Zaterran friend.
REPTILE: Listen, and join us. I know things about Mileena. Her troubled rule will fall in the telling - and pave the way for Ko'atal.
D'VORAH: What would you know that would cause-- The doors to the apartment are forced open. The three turn to face eight Tarkatans who quickly surround them. Mileena walks in a moment later, flanked by both Ermac and the general of the Tarkatans, Baraka.
MILEENA: Ah, there they are. Three of your fellow councillors, whispering like handmaidens. About what, I wonder?
KOTAL: If only you would hear our counsel. As war with Netherrealm looms, I have urged detente with Earthrealm.
MILEENA: And I'VE told you I would sooner die than treat with my father's murderers!
KOTAL: You refuse practical solutions to credible threats. You endanger the realm.
MILEENA: And sedition does not? Speak your last, before I have your tongue.
REPTILE: You are not Shao Kahn's true heir! She is a construct; formed in Shang Tsung's Flesh Pits. I saw this. Your best claim to the throne is moot.
MILEENA: How dare you! I succeed Shao Kahn by his decree!
KOTAL: Succeed him you have. But Outworld demands new leadership.
MILEENA: From you? Osh-Tekk fool! Kill him!
D'VORAH: This One serves Mileena no longer!
MILEENA: You will defend your Empress!
ERMAC: Our creator, Shao Kahn, is dead. We will serve whom we choose.
D'VORAH: Still you follow Mileena?
BARAKA: Shao Kahn conquered my realm. I owe him my loyalty. I honour his will.
D'VORAH: Baraka is dead. Your last ally has left you.
KOTAL: Take her away.
ERMAC: We would serve the new ruler of Outworld.
D'VORAH: Then you serve... Kotal Kahn.
D'VORAH: There.
RAIN: Here to surrender, traitor?
D'VORAH: You would speak of treason? This One knows you desire the throne. Why serve Mileena?
RAIN: I advise her. Stealing the amulet was my genius. It kills her a bit each time she uses it.
D'VORAH: As both sides diminish, you fill the void.
RAIN: Exactly my plan.
RAIN: A shame you will not see it's fruition.
D'VORAH: Your schemes end here.
TANYA: Leaving without your friend, D'Vorah?
TANYA: Your people believe we avoided your island out of respect for your solitary nature. We just didn't like you.
D'VORAH: The Kytinn do prefer solitude - which I will achieve momentarily.
D'VORAH: Now two Edenians will die.
CASSIE: I know you said you weren't friends, but you're not killing them. Head's fine, by the way.
D'VORAH: Very well. Let us go.
D'VORAH: Step aside.
CASSIE: That... is really disturbing.
MILEENA: D'Vorah!
D'VORAH: This One knew you would not stray far from the amulet.
MILEENA: You took my throne. Now you wish to steal my means of reclaiming it?!
D'VORAH: Neither was meant for you!
MILEENA: WHO ARE YOU TO SAY?! I will take something of yours - your LIFE!
D'VORAH: This One will enjoy your death.
MILEENA: Enough of your prattle. Finish me, that I may join my father.
KOTAL: You do not deserve death by an emperor's hand. Instead I give the honour to my worthy First Minister.
KOTAL: The rebellion is over.
CASSIE: Well, thanks for that. I know I'll never eat again.
CASSIE: With your leave, we're gonna head back to Earthrealm. Put the amulet back where it belongs.
CASSIE: The hell are you doing?!
KOTAL: Earthrealm cannot be trusted to protect the amulet. It will remain with me.
KUNG JIN: The Reiko Accords require that you--
KOTAL: The Accords no longer concern me. But you may prove useful - when Raiden comes for this.
D'VORAH: This One deceived them.
D'VORAH: The amulet is in Kotal Kahn's possession.
UNKNOWN: You can retrieve it?
D'VORAH: He trusts no one else to transport it.
UNKNOWN: Keeping you close to the Outworld throne these many years has proven most fortunate, D'Vorah.
QUAN CHI: They never suspected one of their own to be a disciple of our lord.
D'VORAH: This One lives to serve Shinnok.
QUAN CHI: You have done well. Now bring it to me.
D'VORAH: Without delay, Quan Chi.
KUNG LAO: Master.
LIU KANG: What news from Outworld?
QUAN CHI: Shinnok will soon be freed. We make for my fortress.
SOLDIER #1: Is there a problem?
D'VORAH: Two problems.
SONYA: Your wife told me I'd find you in here.
JAX: You and Vera have a nice chat?
SONYA: Always.
SONYA: Is that a National? I haven't seen one this--
JAX: You didn't come to here to discuss farm implements.
SONYA: All right. I'll cut to the chase. I need your help.
JAX: My help?
SONYA: I know. I don't have any right to--
JAX: You knew what I wanted.
SONYA: Jacqui volunteered. She came to me.
JAX: I know.
SONYA: Listen, I get why you didn't want Jacqui joining S-F. Why you retired. I mean, if I had to live with memories of being one of Quan Chi's thugs? I would've eaten a gun a long time ago.
JAX: Well, you know Vera. 
JAX: She never would've allowed that.
JAX: So what is it you need help with? The Outworld refugees?
SONYA: Worse. Shinnok's Amulet. Mileena has it.
JAX: Damn.
SONYA: And we've gotten word from Sareena that Quan Chi has resurfaced in the Netherrealm.
JAX: He shows his face after twenty-five years... just as Shinnok's Amulet is in play. That's not a coincidence.
SONYA: That's why I need you. You're Quan Chi expertise. We wouldn't reactive your commission. You'd be an observer.
JAX: Cage.
JOHNNY: Jax.
SONYA: What is it?
JOHNNY: Just wanted to see if maybe--
JAX: You could help close the deal? Yeah, because that worked out so well last time.
JOHNNY: Can't blame a guy for trying.
SONYA: We need you, Jax. Help me capture Quan Chi. None of us is safe if he gets near that amulet.
JAX: So where's Jacqui in all this?
SONYA: Outworld. With Cassie's team recovering the amulet.
JOHNNY: She'll be fine. We expect to hear "mission accomplished" from them soon.
JACQUI: So what'chu guys think? They gonna kill us?
TAKEDA: They would've done it by now.
KUNG JIN: Unless Kotal Kahn's planning on having us as "guests" at the Koliseum.
CASSIE: Well, if they don't kill us, my mother will. Me, at least.
TAKEDA: Tough being the general's daughter?
CASSIE: You have no idea.
KUNG JIN: I do. My great-whatever grandfather took down Shang Tsung. Saved Earthrealm. How often do you think that comes up at family gatherings?
CASSIE: That was six hundred years ago.
KUNG JIN: And yet you'd think it happened yesterday.
JACQUI: No pressure there.
CASSIE: I've trained all my life... can fight my way out of anything... but I still feel like a second-rate Cage.
TAKEDA: At least you grew up with people expecting things from you.
JACQUI: I thought you and your dad were best friends?
TAKEDA: Now. He was a no-show for a long time.
JACQUI: I can relate.
KUNG JIN: What was that like growing up? Having an ex-revenant father?
TAKEDA: Jin!
KUNG JIN: No, I'm asking! Couldn't have been easy.
JACQUI: ...He was just a BIT over-protective. When I joined S-F, Mister Cage insisted on being the one to tell my dad. He thought it'd go over smoother.
CASSIE: I'll never forget that day. My dad came home with a broken jaw.
TAKEDA: All right, I got this.
CASSIE: You've got what, exactly?
TAKEDA: Trust me.
SOLDIER: Away from the bars!
JACQUI: How'd you do that?
TAKEDA: I overloaded his senses. Only works at short range.
JACQUI: Being the son of a telepath has it's perks.
TAKEDA: I didn't use to think so.
TAKEDA: Yield.
SCORPION: Well done.
SCORPION: You are now Chujin.
TAKEDA: You honour me, Master Hasashi.
TAKEDA: Now that I'm Chujin, how will I serve the clan?
SCORPION: Your future does not lie with the Shirai Ryu.
TAKEDA: But... the clan's my family.
SCORPION: When I took you in, I promised your father--
TAKEDA: I don't have a father.
KENSHI: Yes you do. One who's proud of you. A Chujin in record time.
TAKEDA: You knew he was coming? You said nothing?!
SCORPION: Knowing this would be your reaction, yes.
SCORPION: Takeda! Your father is not your enemy.
TAKEDA: Ten years. No visits, nothing. You abandoned me.
KENSHI: I did not abandon you--
TAKEDA: I was eight! My mother had just died! NOW you come back? Think you can jump right in as the proud dad?
KENSHI: Son, I--
TAKEDA: To hell with you! I am not your son!
TAKEDA: Now get up! I wanna knock you down again!
SCORPION: Takeda, CEASE!
SCORPION: Kenshi did not abandon you. He brought you here for your protection.
TAKEDA: Protection from what?!
SCORPION: From those who murdered your mother.
TAKEDA: She... she died in an accident!
KENSHI: That is the story I asked Master Hasashi to tell you.
KENSHI: But in truth, your mother was killed by Red Dragon assassins. I was the target. Suchin was the victim.
TAKEDA: Son of a bitch! It was your fault!
SCORPION: Your father has devoted his life to fighting animals like the Red Dragon. It is they who are without honour.
TAKEDA: You shouldn't have hidden the truth.
KENSHI: You would have gone after your mother's killers unprepared. I could not risk that. 
KENSHI: Master Hasashi has perfected your fighting skills.
KENSHI: Now it is time to complete your training.
TAKEDA: How-- how did you do that?
KENSHI: We are telepaths. A family gift.
TAKEDA: I can read minds?
KENSHI: Through training, we will determine your full abilities.
KENSHI: And then we will hunt down the Red Dragon. Together.
REPTILE: This is D'Vorah's work.
ERRON: No argument there. Only she could create wounds like these.
TAKEDA: That D'Vorah's full of surprises.
ERRON: Question is, is she working with anyone else?
ERRON: What is it?
TAKEDA: Damn. He's made us.
CASSIE: Okay guys, standard diamond formation. Takeda, you're on point. Jacqui, bring up the rear. Kung Jin, air cover.
KUNG JIN: You got it.
REPTILE: The Earthrealmers! D'Vorah freed them!
TAKEDA: One down. Two to go.
KUNG JIN: When we get back, you're teaching me that.
TAKEDA: Deal. Go help with Ermac. I've got this.
ERRON: Think you can handle me alone? You're either brave or foolish.
TAKEDA: Brave or foolish, I'm alive.
TAKEDA: Let's see what's worth learning in there.
TAKEDA: So many minds... trapped inside...
ERMAC: We exist to serve. Bound by Shao Kahn's magic.
TAKEDA: The chaos... the voices...
ERMAC: We are many. You are one. Your abilities pale before us.
TAKEDA: I think I've had enough of Outworld.
JACQUI: I'm starting to get why my dad retired.
CASSIE: We have to find D'Vorah. Get the amulet.
KUNG JIN: Let's go. They won't be out long.
KOTAL: D'Vorah? And the Earthrealmers?
ERRON: She stole the amulet, then helped them escape.
REPTILE: She betrayed us to the Thunder God.
KOTAL: You wound me, D'Vorah.
KOTAL: Prepare the legions. We go to Earthrealm. We will wrest back the amulet from that devil Raiden.
TAKEDA: We're all in one piece. No one seems to be tailing us.
KENSHI: Have you been able to determine where D'Vorah was headed?
TAKEDA: We think she's headed for the Sea of Blood.
JAX: Damn!
JACQUI: Dad?
JAX: She's coming here. To Quan Chi. There's a secret portal near the Sea of Blood. Quan Chi had it built when we were gettin' ready to invade Outworld.
CASSIE: Great.
JACQUI: Dad, what are you doing? Why are you in the Netherrealm?
JAX: Well, now who's being overprotective?
JACQUI: I know you think you have things to make up for, but--
JAX: I'm doing this for Sonya. She's family.
JACQUI: That's why I'm worried.
JAX: I'll be fine. You stay safe, y'hear?
JACQUI: You stay safe too. I love you. Briggs out.
JAX: Briggs out.
KENSHI: Feeling better? Or worse?
JAX: Not sure. Maybe both.
KENSHI: They'll be fine.
JAX: Question is, will I be?
KENSHI: We have good crossfire position. But why is it Quan Chi travels by conventional means?
SAREENA: He seems unable to fully use his magic. He's weaker than when I was... in his service.
JAX: Sareena's dead on. He doesn't have Shinnok as a power source. He's still Quan Chi, though.
KENSHI: I realise you agreed to guide and observe. But you are welcome to assume any role you wish.
JAX: I'm too rusty. I don't wanna jeopardise the mission.
SAREENA: He approaches.
KENSHI: Now!
JAX: Shit...
KUNG LAO: Do not interfere, Jackson Briggs. Go back into hiding.
JAX: Hiding. I guess I have been.
JAX: That knocked some of my rust off.
SINDEL: Welcome home, Jackson Briggs.
JAX: This hell is not my home.
SINDEL: Then why be fool enough to return? 
JAX: I got a family to protect.
SINDEL: Quan Chi reunited me with my family. He will do the same for you.
JAX: Quan Chi's not helping you.
SAREENA: It is possible to escape Quan Chi, Kitana. I can aid you as Bi-Han aided me.
KITANA: You became too familiar with Bi-Han. Allowed emotion to corrupt you.
SAREENA: Emotion freed me!
JAX: I don't understand, Kitana. I mean, I hate the things I did here. But you enjoy being a revenant!
KITANA: It suits me. I am a victim no longer.
JAX: Yeah, I know what you mean, but this ain't the way to assert yourself.
JAX: I gotta believe there's hope for you.
JAX: Mother o' God...
KENSHI: We've lost many. The rest are wounded.
JAX: And our "friends"?
SAREENA: The tide turned against them. They fled.
JAX: How you two doin'?
KENSHI: I'm fine.
JAX: That's what I thought.
SAREENA: Where are you going?
JAX: Gonna bag me a sorcerer.
KENSHI: Alone?
SAREENA: You'll be killed!
JAX: Wouldn't be the first time.
LIU KANG: In your weakened state, is it possible for you to release Shinnok?
QUAN CHI: I am more than capable.
LIU KANG: And D'Vorah? Are you certain she is capable?
QUAN CHI: She WILL bring the amulet to me.
JAX: And I'll be waiting for her.
QUAN CHI: Jackson Briggs. A pleasant surprise.
JAX: Nothin' pleasent about it.
LIU KANG: So you return to Raiden? The fools follow fools.
JAX: Raiden did his best. He saved Earthrealm!
LIU KANG: HE MURDERED ME!
JAX: That isn't true!
LIU KANG: You were not there! He stole EVERYTHING from me!
LIU KANG: You do not deserve to rejoin us.
LIU KANG: Instead you will learn... there are worse things than death.
JAX: I wish I could help you, Liu Kang.
QUAN CHI: Jax, there is no need for hostil--
JAX: Just stop talking!
JAX: S'good to be back.
JAX: Kenshi. I got 'im.
KENSHI: Excellent work.
JAX: I'm staying here. D'Vorah's on her way. You need to get Quan Chi to Sonya. She'll make 'im spill his guts.
KENSHI: Sit.
JOHNNY: I'm guessing it's not your first time in cuffs. What's your safeword?
SONYA: Advise Secretary Blake that Quan Chi is in custody. We'll be moving him to the super-max facility at Fort Charles within the hour.
SOLDIER: Yes ma'am.
SONYA: You two stand guard. Prisoner transfer will be here in twenty.
JOHNNY: Oh, NOW she trusts me to babysit.
SONYA: Cage, report.
CASSIE: We haven't caught up to D'Vorah. We had her tracked to the Makeba Cliffs, but then her trail went cold.
SONYA: Damn.
CASSIE: Jacqui thinks D'Vorah's unique physiology may allow us to pinpoint her location. She's retooling her smart-comm to track D'Vorah's pheromones.
SONYA: How long?
SCORPION: On my command only. Wound. Do not kill.
CASSIE: She has to write the code. We're looking at... two hours?
SONYA: Sergeant, your team doesn't have two hours. We need her found immediately!
JOHNNY: Sonya!
SONYA: Cassie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but there isn't time. Bring your team back here, we need to re-group and re-deploy.
CASSIE: Yes ma'am.
JOHNNY: They're doing their best.
SONYA: I know.
KENSHI: General. We have a visitor.
SONYA: You two are friends, right? He tell you he was coming?
KENSHI: Nothing.
SCORPION: General.
SONYA: Master Hasashi. I hadn't received word you were coming.
SCORPION: I will have Quan Chi.
SONYA: We have things under control. You can--
SCORPION: He must die.
SONYA: Raiden needs him. Without Quan Chi we can't restore Liu Kand and the other revenants. You'd leave them trapped? Like you were?
SCORPION: Only Quan Chi concerns me.
SONYA: Don't do this, Hanzo. I'll put you down.
SCORPION: Then we are at an impasse.
SCORPION: Quan Chi is mine.
SCORPION: I wish you no harm, General Blade.
KENSHI: Call off your men, Hanzo!
SCORPION: If you value our friendship, you will give me Quan Chi.
SCORPION: Withdraw. Without Sento you are vulnerable.
JOHNNY: Just like old times!
SCORPION: Only Quan Chi's death will abate my anger.
KENSHI: Hanzo, no! You've earned great trust for the Shirai Ryu. Do not squander it by murdering a withered sorcerer!
SCORPION: That withered sorcerer is the architect of my suffering.
SUB-ZERO: Master Hasashi. I am grateful that you've come.
SCORPION: Speak your mind. I do not wish to linger here.
SUB-ZERO: You re-establish the Shirai-Ryu as I reform the Lin Kuei. We both seek to shed our clans' dark pasts. Dedicate them to Earthrealm's protection.
SUB-ZERO: Our common purpose gives us a chance to end old rivalries. To start anew.
SCORPION: You'll confess what you've long denied? That your clan's hands are soaked in Shirai-Ryu blood? In the blood of my family?
SUB-ZERO: ...Our honour is indeed stained. Please. Sit.
SUB-ZERO: After you and I were freed from Quan Chi's control, I sought out my clan. I had hoped rebellion from within would have quashed the Grandmaster's plans. 
SUB-ZERO: But Sektor had realised his father's vision. The Lin Kuei had benn fully cyberized. I pledged to kill Sektor and his followers. Re-form the Lin Kuei and restore our honour.
SCORPION: I am not interested in Lin Kuei politics, Sub-Zero.
SUB-ZERO: When I finally killed Sektor, I discovered the Lin Kuei had not sacrificed it's honour with the Cyber Initiative. We had abandoned it long before.
FROST: There will be no peace, Scorpion!
SCORPION: Frost! The Lin Kuei are still without honour!
SUB-ZERO: Master Hasashi, wait!
SCORPION: For what? More treachery? I will have your head!
SCORPION: Our story ends here, Sub-Zero.
SCORPION: What is this?!
SUB-ZERO: I did not bring you here for treachery. Frost is strong, but lacks judgment. She cannot see the wisdom of peace. I will deal with her.
SCORPION: You spoke of the Lin Kuei's lost honour.
SUB-ZERO: For years, I had thought you had unfairly blamed the Lin Kuei for the deaths of your family and clan.
SUB-ZERO: But Sektor's cyber-preserved memories revealed the truth.
QUAN CHI: The Lin Kuei need to abide their agreements, Sektor. The Grandmaster gave Shinnok his word.
SEKTOR: Shinnok's currency is lies. As is yours.
QUAN CHI: Payment is due. I exterminated the Shirai-Ryu as promised.
SEKTOR: Hanzo Hasashi lives. He's your spectre, Scorpion.
QUAN CHI: I created Scorpion from Hasashi's soul AFTER he died. We observed the agreement.
SEKTOR: The letter, not the spirit. You are owed nothing.
SCORPION: Harumi... Satoshi...
SUB-ZERO: Had I known of my clan's complicity in the Shirai-Ryu's extinction, our history would be different.
SCORPION: I killed your brother because I thought... he--
SUB-ZERO: Quan Chi is responsible for Bi-Han's death.
SCORPION: Sektor was wrong. There is a debt to be paid - and Quan Chi will pay it.
SCORPION: Unbind him.
QUAN CHI: Scorpion, we can--
SCORPION: MY NAME IS HANZO HASASHI!!
SCORPION: You killed my wife! My son! And then you burrowed your way into my head! Misdirected my VENGEANCE! COST ME MY ONE CHANCE TO HAVE THEM RESTORED!
QUAN CHI: Your family... I--
SCORPION: Quiet, sorcerer! Nothing can help you now!
SCORPION: At last, you feel my pain.
SONYA: Scorpion, stop!
D'VORAH: Quan Chi!
QUAN CHI: Amulet...
SCORPION: GET OVER HERE!
D'VORAH: No!
SCORPION: Blood for blood. Your debt is paid.
JOHNNY: Oh shit.
SONYA: Free us! Now!
D'VORAH: Shinnok.
SHINNOK: How small they are.
D'VORAH: This One greets Lord Shinnok.
SHINNOK: Quan Chi chose his servants well. He was wise to restore me in Earthrealm, behind their defenses.
D'VORAH: Quan Chi deceived them. Allowed himself to be captured. He knew they would bring him here.
SHINNOK: A pity he did not live to see his work completed.
SHINNOK: There will be no surprises from you, Mister Cage. Bring him.
LIU KANG: Praise be to Lord Shinnok.
SHINNOK: Let us be on our way.
LIU KANG: There is an Earthrealm force in Netherrealm.
SHINNOK: I am aware. They will be neutralised.
CASSIE: Oh, shit!
CASSIE: Mom!
CASSIE: Where's Dad?
SONYA: Shinnok...
CASSIE: Mom, mom, where'd they go?
CASSIE: Mom?!
SCORPION: Your father... Shinnok's prisoner... at the Sky Temple.
BO'RAI CHO: Raiden! Raiden, my old friend!
RAIDEN: Master Bo'Rai Cho. I am pleased to see you. It has been many years.
BO'RAI CHO: Too long, yes, too long. We old warriors need to stick together, eh?
RAIDEN: Most certainly. I presume recent circumstances precipitate your arrival?
BO'RAI CHO: Yes, yes. I'm concerned that Shinnok may return. I've been trying to contact you. I feared the worst.
RAIDEN: When Kano misappropriated Shinnok's Amulet, he left behind a snare. Disabling it required that I travel to many strange realms. I must retire to the Jinsei Chamber. Regain my strength.
BO'RAI CHO: You are close to recovering it, then? Shinnok's Amulet?
RAIDEN: I do not know. Disabling Kano's snare demanded my full attention. Once I am rejuvenated, I will confer with General Blade.
BO'RAI CHO: If only we could have destroyed Shinnok during the last war. If only he were mortal.
BO'RAI CHO: Such beauty. Like gazing upon the Elder Gods themselves.
RAIDEN: I hold out hope that we can turn this crisis to our advantage.
BO'RAI CHO: How so?
RAIDEN: Quan Chi's magic binds the souls of many we hold dear. Capture him, and we can force him to release them.
BO'RAI CHO: Liu Kang and Kung Lao restored? I suppose it is possible.
RAIDEN: As long as Quan Chi lives.
RAIDEN: I've long regretted losing our comrades' souls to Netherrealm's evil. Kung Lao and Liu Kang... they were like sons. I would move the Heavens to bring them back into the light.
KUNG LAO: It is as Master Bo'Rai Cho said. The Shaolin masters are aboard that ship.
LIU KANG: Bo'Rai Cho said two ships.
RAIDEN: The other has disembarked. We need to determine it's location.
KUNG LAO: They will talk. I will see to it.
LIU KANG: No extraordinary means, Kung Lao.
KUNG LAO: They raided the Wu Shi Academy! Killed Master Wen!
RAIDEN: Even with Tarkatans, there are boundaries we do not cross.
KUNG LAO: Yes, Lord Raiden.
LIU KANG: I still cannot believe Shao Kahn would order such a brazen attack.
RAIDEN: It demonstrated Earthrealm's vulnerability. Shao Kahn knew we would have no choice but to agree to a new tournament.
KUNG LAO: Liu Kang defeated Shang Tsung. He will beat Shao Kahn.
RAIDEN: In good time, Kung Lao. First we free the Shaolin.
D'VORAH: All are aboard? This One leaves with the tide.
BARAKA: We are ready.
D'VORAH: Shao Kahn demands the hostages be unharmed.
BARAKA: Their wounds are not fatal.
D'VORAH: I would hope, Baraka. For your sake.
RAIDEN: For yours as well.
RAIDEN: If you harm them, you answer to me.
D'VORAH: Tarkatans are beaten so easily?
BARAKA: Empty threats, Raiden. You will not see the tournament!
RAIDEN: You will return to the Wastes with no prize.
RAIDEN: Step aside.
D'VORAH: Such power. What are you, Raiden?
RAIDEN: I am of truth and light. I protect Earthrealm.
D'VORAH: This One cares not for Earthrealm and worships no gods.
RAIDEN: When a god speaks, heed him.
KUNG LAO: They were not so vexing. All sneers and growls.
RAIDEN: Let us free those aboard this vessel. Then you will find the second ship.
KUNG LAO: Where will you go, Lord Raiden?
RAIDEN: The tournament beings soon. Join me as soon as you are able.
LIU KANG: We will succeed, Lord Raiden.
RAIDEN: Of that I am certain.
RAIDEN: Bo'Rai Cho!
SHINNOK: Yet another of your allies falls to me. When he dies, I will claim his soul.
RAIDEN: You know not his power. His soul cannot be subjugated.
LIU KANG: Shall we kill him, Lord Shinnok?
SHINNOK: Not yet. He will bear witness as I conquer his realm. Then I will imprison him as he did me.
RAIDEN: I would not boast of victory prematurely.
SHINNOK: I have already won, Raiden.
RAIDEN: Kung Lao, desist!
KUNG LAO: I serve Shinnok and the Netherrealm.
RAIDEN: Because Shao Kahn murdered you!
KUNG LAO: Something YOU allowed to happen! I will not be so passive in your demise!
RAIDEN: You deserved a better fate.
RAIDEN: This is not your destiny, Liu Kang.
LIU KANG: More visions, Raiden? Do you still see the future?
RAIDEN: The visions are gone, but I know what should be.
LIU KANG: I was put here by your hand.
RAIDEN: An accident, which haunts me to this day!
LIU KANG: I should thank you. You freed me. The Elder Gods you blindly serve? I will help Shinnok end their rule!
RAIDEN: I regret our paths have led here.
RAIDEN: You will not defile the Jinsei, Shinnok!
SHINNOK: We have battled for eons, Raiden. Now finally, it ends.
SHINNOK: Yes... Tremble before me, Elder Gods, as I absorb Earthrealm's power.
RAIDEN: No, Shinnok. Even now... others come to defeat you.
CASSIE: We land in fifteen minutes. We'll enter the Sky Temple from the terrestrial entrance.
TAKEDA: Why not go straight there?
KUNG JIN: It exists in a different quantum state, slightly out of phase from our reality. It can't be reached by conventional means.
JACQUI: What?
TAKEDA: It's just us. No one's coming to help. We either pull this off or--
CASSIE: We WILL get it done.
KUNG JIN: By the... what is that?!
TAKEDA: Dunno. But it's headed right for us.
KUNG JIN: Elder Gods have mercy.
JACQUI: Buckle up, people! I gotta put her down.
JACQUI: Looks like the temple entrance is fifteen clicks that way.
TAKEDA: A moonlight walk in the woods. Another time, it'd be relaxing.
JACQUI: I wouldn't have pegged you for outdoorsy.
TAKEDA: My mother and I lived near a forest a lot like this. Really takes me back.
JACQUI: After we wrap this up, we should go.
CASSIE: Fuck me! We're grounded. That shockwave fried the leads.
JACQUI: Then let's get going. We're almost outta time.
KUNG JIN: What are they doing here?
JACQUI: Looking for the amulet, I bet.
TAKEDA: We have to tell them about Shinnok. Call a truce.
KOTAL: Bring them to me!
CASSIE: Or not.
JACQUI: The woods! C'mon!
FERRA: They quiet. Sneaky.
KOTAL: Ermac?
ERMAC: We sense them. But the forest teems with souls.
REPTILE: Yes... So close.
KOTAL: Divine fire and earth!
REPTILE: I see you...
TAKEDA: Jacqui, look out!
JACQUI: You hurt him, you answer to me!
JACQUI: Go crawl back under your rock, Reptile.
JACQUI: Stop! You need water.
JACQUI: Lean your head back.
JACQUI: Can you see?
TAKEDA: Yeah, yeah. It's fuzzy, but--
JACQUI: Better?
TAKEDA: Beautiful.
JACQUI: Hold that thought.
TAKEDA: Lady's choice.
JACQUI: I've got Ermac.
ERMAC: You are spawn of Jackson Briggs.
JACQUI: And damn proud of it! I know what you did to him.
ERMAC: We took your father's arms. We will take all of you.
JACQUI: That was for you, Dad.
FERRA: Squeeze, squeeze, Torr!
FERRA: Your eyes, so bright.
FERRA: Gonna carve 'em out!
FERRA: Trickery! Deceit!
JACQUI: No more tricks. Just a straight up beatdown.
JACQUI: Two for one. I'll take it.
KOTAL: We know D'Vorah is here. Where is the amulet?
TAKEDA: Kotal Kahn, the situation has changed--
KOTAL: Do not fling your spittle at me.
JACQUI: You tell 'im?
TAKEDA: Not yet!
JACQUI: He needs to kno--
TAKEDA: Busy!
KOTAL: I will kill you both.
JACQUI: Shinnok's been freed. He's at Raiden's Sky Temple. He's already infected Earthrealm's life force.
KOTAL: The heavens boil... Earthrealm is lost!
JACQUI: Not if we hang together!
KOTAL: I will appease Shinnok. Bring him your heads. Gain time to bolster Outworld's defenses.
JACQUI: You need to help us, Kotal Kahn!
KOTAL: It is too late for Earthrealm. Shinnok is now it's master.
JACQUI: You should'a been with us.
ERRON: That's enough.
CASSIE: Fuck me!
JACQUI: Don't know about you guys, but I'm living the dream.
TAKEDA: You have odd dreams.
KOTAL: Chattel. You die tonight.
SUB-ZERO: You stood together against formidable odds. Lesser warriors would not have fared so well.
CASSIE: Thanks, Grandmaster.
SUB-ZERO: I will remain here to push Kotal Kahn back to Outworld. Proceed to the Sky Temple. Earthrealm's fate lies with you.
D'VORAH: Lord Shinnok is nearly finished. Soon the Jinsei's corruption will be irreversable.
KITANA: The invasion can then proceed. Raiden and his allies will be unable to offer resistance.
LIU KANG: Once the realm falls, our path to victory will be clear. Advise Lord Shinnok that the Oni and Orochi are ready. At his command, we'll unleash them on Earthrealm.
LIU KANG: Have you found Raiden's portal to the Heavens?
KUNG LAO: Yes, but his wards protect it. We can't break through.
KITANA: That is unacceptable. After Earthrealm is destroyed, we must complete Lord Shinnok's vengeance; invade the Heavens and destroy the Elder Gods.
LIU KANG: Come.
TAKEDA: Make war on the Heavens?! If Shinnok can take down the Elder Gods--
JACQUI: End of the universe. Got it.
KUNG JIN: Kung Lao... to see him like this...
CASSIE: We'll all be hangin' 'round the Netherrealm water cooler if we don't pull this off. C'mon.
JACQUI: Takeda!
SINDEL: Has your mother ever told you what I did to her friends? Killed them all in the blink of an eye.
CASSIE: And your own daughter. You proud of that?
SINDEL: We are bonded in death. You will join us and I will give you a proper upbringing!
CASSIE: Nice offer, Mommy Dearest, but I'll pass.
TAKEDA: I owe you one.
JACQUI: I'll remember that.
CASSIE: Back off, princess!
KITANA: You think mere words can stop me?
CASSIE: Thanks for the assist.
JACQUI: Any time.
TAKEDA: Tick tock, ladies.
CASSIE: No!
KITANA: You wish to die first? So be it.
CASSIE: You're not killing anyone.
CASSIE: Help Jacqui!
CASSIE: Messed you up pretty bad.
TAKEDA: Ugh, great bedside manner. I can fight.
CASSIE: Jacqui?
JACQUI: It's nothing. Just like Kurdistan.
TAKEDA: You two go. Jacqui and I'll handle them.
CASSIE: What?
JACQUI: We'll just slow you down.
KUNG JIN: Forget it!
CASSIE: Damn it. Keep your heads down. I'll see you on the other side.
D'VORAH: They taste your flesh. Burrow deep. Inside you they will grow. Gnaw your innards.
KUNG JIN: By the gods!
CASSIE: DAD!
D'VORAH: First father, then daughter. Will they taste the same?
CASSIE: You're the bug? I'm the windshield.
JOHNNY: Hey... Punkin...
CASSIE: I'm a little old for "Punkin".
JOHNNY: No... Get... Shinnok.
CASSIE: But--
JOHNNY: I love you.
CASSIE: Dad?
SHINNOK: So you are the issue of Johnny Cage. Fitting that I exterminate his entire line.
CASSIE: You want him, you're gonna go through me.
SHINNOK: Yes, that's better. Watch, Miss Cage, as I rend your father's flesh.
SHINNOK: This is what awaits those who defy me: excruciating, exquisite death.
CASSIE: You son of a BITCH!
CASSIE: Holy shit, it does run in the family!
SHINNOK: Your father's power will not save you. You cannot hope to survive!
CASSIE: You got Caged.
KUNG JIN: That you? Nice.
RAIDEN: Cassandra Cage...
RAIDEN: Put me... in the Jinsei.
CASSIE: What?
KUNG JIN: But you're-- it-- it'll kill you!
RAIDEN: Must... be... cleansed. Hurry.
LIU KANG: We must withdraw.
TAKEDA: That moonlight walk... can it wait?
JACQUI: No walks. Poolside. Umbrella drinks.
TAKEDA: Deal.
CASSIE: Is he alive?
KUNG JIN: Barely. I'll help him. Help your father.
JOHNNY: And to think... I was worried when you started dating.
CASSIE: Afraid I'd come home with someone like you?
JOHNNY: Funny, beautiful, saves the world. My work here is done.
SONYA: This way! In here!
SONYA: Isolate Shinnok and D'Vorah. And get the medic!
SONYA: We'll fix you up. Help is on the way.
JOHNNY: You shoulda seen Cass. Wiped the floor with Shinnok.
SONYA: I believe it. And you... you did a great job with your team, Johnny.
JOHNNY: You hear that, Cass? She called me "Johnny".
CASSIE: I thought she might.
RAIDEN: Too long have I allowed Earthrealm to endure the horrors of war. Time and again we've defeated our enemies. But we've exacted no retribution. Demanded no remuneration. What have we gained for our mercy? More intrigue. More senseless violence. As the new rulers of the Netherrealm, heed me. No longer will I simply defend Earthrealm. I will seek out and destroy all who threaten it. No mercy will be shown. No quarter given.
RAIDEN: Shinnok was an Elder God. Impossible to kill. There are fates worse than death.
