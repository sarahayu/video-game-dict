UNKNOWN: "RADIO: Playing pre-recorded distress call...\nOFFICER KEEN: This is Officer Keen in Lifepod 19! The captain is gone. I have assumed command.\nThe last thing the captain did was give me co-ordinates for dry land. We regroup one and a half kilometers south-west of the crash site.\nStay together, and good luck.

UNKNOWN: "RADIO: Playing pre-recorded distress call...\nThis is Ozzy from the cafeteria, what the hell guys?! They didn't warn us this might happen!\nOur pod was almost crushed by the seamoth bay on the way down, now we're hanging on the edge of a cave system and this grim-looking snake-thing's trying to eat through the hull!\nCome get us already!"
UNKNOWN: "RADIO: This is an automated distress signal from Lifepod 12, co-ordinates attached.\nWarning: Lifepod has sunk beyond safe diving distance. Do not attempt retrieval without submersible support."
UNKNOWN: "RADIO: Playing pre-recorded distress call...\nCTO YU: This is Lifepod 2, co-ordinates attached! We're way past our safe depth and bleeding O2.\nWe'll have to swim for the surface, but it's 500 meters straight up.\nWe'll make for the rendezvous and keep you posted. Out."
UNKNOWN: "RADIO: This is lifepod 4!\nWe've landed close to the Aurora, flotation devices active, but we've got some big old fish in the water with us and I don't know how long we're going to last.\nWe're close to the crash site so bring radiation protection. 4, out."

UNKNOWN: "The plant life in this area is growing outside its normal conditions.\nOther lifeforms fertilizing and pruning the vegetation may be offsetting this environmental deficit."
UNKNOWN: "This is Avery Quinn of trading ship Sunbeam. Aurora, do you read? Over.\nNothing but vacuum. These Alterra ships. They run low on engine grease, they send an S.O.S.; you offer to help, they don't pick up.\nAurora, I'm out on the far side of the system, it's going to take more than a week to reach your position, do you still need our assistance? Over.\nI'll try them again tomorrow. See what the long-range scanner picks up in the meantime. Damn charter's going to have us wasting our credits running errands for Alterra."
UNKNOWN: "Aurora, this is Sunbeam again. We just picked up a massive debris field at your location.\nI didn't know how bad... How many of you... I didn't know.\nWe are now on route to your location. We're going to bring you home. Sunbeam out.\nWhat else can I say? The only time I parked a rig this big on a rock that small was in VR, and I blew it.\nOh, it's a bad option alright, but so are all the others."
UNKNOWN: "This is Sunbeam. Y'know, Aurora, we're from a little trans-gov on the far side of Andromeda, and we have a saying there.\nThere's no bad without the good, no good without the bad.\nSounds like you tasted a bunch of the former, but that only means you're overdue a whole lot of the latter.\nMight just be we're it.\nWe're scanning for somewhere to park, we'll be in touch when we find it. Sunbeam out."
UNKNOWN: "Aurora, we're approaching the planet now, and we have a landing site for you that's... well, it's better than the alternatives.\nWe've sent you the coordinates.\nIt'll take us a couple of days to align our orbit, we should be able to establish direct contact with you during that time, then we're coming in to get you.\nCross your fingers the weather holds, and don't leave us waiting. Sunbeam out."
UNKNOWN: "Survivor, we see you!\nMan, I don't know how you held out down there.\nWe've broken atmosphere and we're descending towards the landing site.\nIs that a building down there?! What do you mean you can't identify it?\nHold on, no turning back now *Static*\nPositions everyone, touching down in 10, 9, 8-\nIt's coming from the building?! Change course, set thrusters to (full)- *Sirens*\n*Static*
UNKNOWN: "PDA: Picking up orbital transponder signature of trading vessel Sunbeam.\nVessel is approaching planet surface and initiating surface scanning procedures.\nDetecting massive power surge from anomalous contact. Energy discharge detected.\nVessel signature lost."
UNKNOWN: "Aurora survivors, this is trading ship Sunbeam.\nWe've tracked your distress signal, but your ship's left a substantial debris field up in orbit, we can't attempt a landing.\nWe're gonna have to head home.\nWe'll send our data to Alterra as soon as we can. Hold on in there. Sunbeam, out."
UNKNOWN: "Are you here... to play?\nOthers came here once. They built these walls.\nThey played... alone. They bored me.\nNow they're gone. And instead... we have you.\nWe are curious whether you swim with the current, or fight against it as they did."
UNKNOWN: "My young want to hatch.\nTo play outside this place.\nWe have been here so long.\nThe others built a passage to reach the world outside.\nI asked them for this freedom, but they could not hear me.\nIf you help us, I will give you freely what the others tried in vain to take."
UNKNOWN: "With the passage you have opened my young can leave this place.\nBut first they must feel the time is right and break free of their shells.\nThis is what the others could not force from me.\nTo you, I give the secret willingly."
UNKNOWN: "My young are swimming for the shallows.\nI thank you.\nTheir freedom is my end.\nWhat will it be like, I wonder, to go to sleep and never wake up?\nPerhaps next we meet I will be an ocean current, carrying seeds to a new land...\nOr a creature so small it sees the gaps between the grains of sand.\nFarewell, friend."
UNKNOWN: "What is a wave without the ocean?\nA beginning without an end?\nThey are different, but they go together.\nNow you go among the stars, and I fall among the sand.\nWe are different.\nBut we go... together."

UNKNOWN: "This is Avery Quinn of trading ship Sunbeam. Aurora, do you read? Over. Still nothing. These Alterra ships. They run out of engine grease, they send an SOS; you offer to help, they don't pick up. Aurora, we're out on the far side of the system, it's going to take more than a week to reach your position, do you still need our assistance? Over. I'll try them again tomorrow. See what the long-range scanner picks up in the meantime. Damn charter's going to have us wasting our profit margin running errands for Alterra."
UNKNOWN: "Aurora, this is Sunbeam again. We just picked up a massive debris field at your location. I didn't know how bad... How many of you... I didn't know. We are now en route to your location. We're going to bring you home. Sunbeam out. What else can I say? We're a six seater, and we aren't even slightly equipped to handle this? Our pilot last attempted a planet landing in the academy simulator? Oh, it's a bad option alright, but so are all the others."
UNKNOWN: "Sunbeam, broadcasing to all survivors of the Aurora. We've covered more than half the distance, so hold on in there. We're scanning the planet for dry land as we speak. You couldn't have picked a less convenient parking spot, but we'll be in touch as soon as we have a landing site for you. Sunbeam out."
UNKNOWN: "Aurora, its Sunbeam. We've made orbit, and scans have found a landing site on the planet that's only rated hazardous. It's our best shot. We've sent you the coordinates. We'll be there in two days time. Cross your fingers the weather holds, and don't leave us waiting. Sunbeam out."
UNKNOWN: "PDA: Attention - Patching in a local broadcast from the Sunbeam.\nI don't believe it, there's someone down there!\nAurora survivor, we have your PDA signature! I don't know how you walked away from that wreck, let alone survived since then, but we'll be happy to bring you onboard and hightail back to federation space.\nStand back, we're approaching the landing site now. Breaking atmosphere in 5... 4... 3...\nWhat is that? No, the RED spike. From the planet?! *Static*
UNKNOWN: "Aurora survivors, this is trading ship Sunbeam.\nWe've tracked your distress signal, but your ship's left a giant debris field up in orbit, we can't attempt a landing.\nWe're gonna have to head home.\nWe'll send our data to Alterra as soon as we can. Hold on in there. Sunbeam, out."
