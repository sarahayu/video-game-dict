Killjoy: "Sorry little mouse"
Omen: "Stay alive, Sabine"
Killjoy: "Quick peeks now"
Sova: "Omen, we will find your answer. You will not be this way forever. I promise"
Omen: "Sage, you are truly...limitless"
Omen: "I am not just a shadow"
Reyna: "Who's the hunter now?!"
Breach: "Never been in a knife fight, have you?"
Reyna: "I was not meant for this climate, let's go!"
Omen: "They died underneath our boots"
Yoru: "Ouch!"
Breach: "Buying"
Jett: "Hey Phoenix! If I die? Viking funeral, all the way"
Jett: "Her slow fields are so annoying!"
Breach: "Blinding"
Omen: "Do they know what it means to be...truly...afraid? I'll show them"
Killjoy: "Aha, the cool kid in class has some brains too! Impressive!"
Breach: "Amateur"
Sova: "One step closer"
Omen: "I let go for a second!"
Killjoy: "Turret destroyed"
Breach: "I don't have to pack heavy. These arms are heavy enough"
Yoru: "That Cypher thinks he sees everything. I go invisible, idiot! Come get me!"
Jett: "What would you all do without me?"
Killjoy: "Their defense...uhh...could be better"
Killjoy: "How about I only bring a ruler next time" *laughs*
Yoru: "They're tough. おもしれ" ("They're tough. Interesting")
Sova: "There is no retreat. Not when annihilation is at stake. This is our day"
Sova: "It is over"
Jett: "I still can't get over that owl, Sova. It's too cute. Why is it so cute?"
Omen: "Again. Hurt them again"
Omen: "Rest. It is done"
Killjoy: "Fish in a barrel"
Killjoy: "Variable removed"
Yoru: "They must have a death wish or something"
Breach: "Pitiful"
Omen: "Worthless dead fools"
Killjoy: "Recalling my bot"
Breach: "The fools gave us a window. Smash through it!"
Omen: "You thought you could escape my nightmare?!"
Killjoy: "We can keep them out"
Killjoy: "Don't die. If you need help figuring out how, just ask!"
Jett: "I'm faster than Skye's wolves"
Breach: "Change of plans"
Killjoy: "Why is no one wearing the pulse monitors I gave you? Honestly, I ask for a few readouts and you think I'm Doctor Frankenstein..."
Killjoy: "Where are we going this time? Remember what worked in the past"
Reyna: "Somehow the hunger always lingers..."
Sova: "I did not expect a healer to fight so well. You are incredible"
Jett: "Woo! We got this"
Killjoy: "Got one!"
Reyna: "Forgive me if I don't grieve"
Jett: "See ya!"
Breach: "Where are they, Cypher?"
Sova: "Need a drop"
Yoru: "Class dismissed"
Yoru: "Hit them when they're not looking"
Breach: "Hejdå"
Breach: "Let that Phoenix run his mouth. We'll shut him up soon enough"
Jett: "C'mon guys, take out their healer! It's super annoying to kill people twice"
Jett: "Eyes down"
Killjoy: "Sage killed"
Breach: "We doing this or what?"
Sova: "Jett! You were amazing!"
Yoru: "Don't get up"
Breach: "Too late!"
Yoru: "You're all obsessed with teamwork, so I'll try it. But just this once"
Yoru: "Keep after them!"
Breach: "No one beats me! No one..."
Killjoy: "Sure, but if anything explodes again, you are telling Brim"
Killjoy: "Terminated"
Omen: "We are not done"
Reyna: "Don't resist"
Breach: "Killed the rat!"
Reyna: "My reflection is here. Do me a favour, cariño. Kill her" (""My reflection is here. Do me a favour, darling. Kill her"")
Jett: "Yeah! Let's bring it back"
Yoru: "Your biggest mistake was that you pissed me off"
Killjoy: "I had to focus for a second"
Reyna: "Don't insult me"
Omen: "If I must live in this nightmare, my enemies might as well join me"
Breach: "Gutted!"
Breach: "Nothing fancy, uh? We go in, we crush them, we get out"
Killjoy: "Keep doing what you do best!"
Jett: "Too easy"
Sova: "Okay Cypher, I admit. That was good"
Omen: "Spend everything. We keep nothing"
Omen: "Now rest"
Jett: "Need a drop"
Sova: "Who else do you have?!"
Jett: "Owls, hawks...what the hell? The sky's crowded nowadays"
Sova: "Break away"
Killjoy: "Goodbye!"
Killjoy: "Let's see. Battles are won by geniuses. And I am a genius. Sooo..."
Sova: "Thank you"
Reyna: "Buying"
Yoru: "Let's clean up. We're done here"
Sova: "Protect our homeland"
Jett: "Dying, would've sucked"
Sova: "A little recognition is nice, now and then. Thank you"
Omen: "I survived obliteration. I will survive them"
Reyna: "Okay Omen, you won that round"
Omen: "Goodbye, Sabine"
Reyna: "Pathetic!"
Killjoy: "Nearly perfect"
Yoru: "Have fun in hell!"
Yoru: "Lights out"
Jett: "Don't mess up that pretty face, Phoenix"
Sova: "Good thing I was with you, yes?"
Breach: "Let's have some fun"
Reyna: "Brimstone, if you must live, then live well. Where do we go?"
Breach: "Quit your tiptoeing. They're all dead"
Yoru: "A bunch of ざこ want to fight us. They must really want to die" ("A bunch of minnows want to fight us. They must really want to die")
Reyna: "All dead, *scoffs*, and I'm still hungry"
Killjoy: "Don't worry team. If you die, I have your memories backed up at base! Heh, just kidding, just kidding...or am I..."
Sova: "If you're not a good shot today, don't worry. There are other ways to be useful"
Killjoy: "Reyna, I can see why you don't want any of my tech. You're scary enough without it"
Yoru: "This isn't over!"
Killjoy: "You should run"
Breach: "Behind me"
Reyna: "I will rip their hearts out"
Reyna: "Forgive me if I don't grieve"
Yoru: "I'll cut through"
Jett: "Keep those heals comin'!"
Reyna: "How did we forget the spike?"
Sova: "Now four"
Jett: "Whatever. Good for now"
Killjoy: "Oh, we're almost done? Cool, hehe, cool cool cool"
Reyna: "Breach killed"
Breach: "They want a fight? Let's fight"
Yoru: "Four"
Jett: "You better hide, old man!"
Sova: "Don't forget who you are, Omen. A man, not a monster"
Reyna: "Need a drop"
Jett: "Aww, at least they tried"
Killjoy: "Final test!"
Sova: "Hunt them down"
Omen: "They're weak. Good"
Reyna: "Don't insult me"
Reyna: "Cower, run!"
Killjoy: "Recalling my bot"
Jett: "Wooh, okay! Sauna time!"
Jett: "Feels like just yesterday I was chopping 달래 at the store. Wonder if that place is still standing..." ("Feels like just yesterday I was chopping Korean wild chive at the store. Wonder if that place is still standing...")
Reyna: "If I act superior, it's because I am"
Sova: "Deep breath"
Jett: "Let's go!"
Reyna: "Such trash!"
Jett: "I have extra money if anyone needs"
Breach: "I'm ready"
Omen: "That was incredible, Reyna. And they call me the monster..."
Yoru: "Looking for me?"
Omen: "I will rip the light from them"
Reyna: "Cypher buried"
Breach: "What the hell were the rest of you doing?!"
Killjoy: "Final test!"
Omen: "Unimportant"
Killjoy: "Swarm grenade out"
Omen: "Silence"
Killjoy: "Got them all!"
Jett: "Let's crack them open"
Sova: "One target left"
Breach: "In a fair fight I'd still kill you"
Sova: "Cut down"
Omen: "Close, I am so close!"
Sova: "I'm gearing up"
Sova: "Perfect"
Killjoy: "Viper, do you mind if I run today's tests. You're...a little too biased...no offense"
Omen: "Petty things"
Breach: "Dusted"
Killjoy: "Nice and easy"
Jett: "Poison's gone"
Reyna: "Jett, you're very talented. Aim for the neck. Easy kill"
Jett: "Bye!"
Breach: ""Mandou bem", Raze! How's that for pronunciation, huh?" *laughs*
Reyna: "I get what I want"
Killjoy: "Cypher, your homemade gadgets are soo cute! Reminds me of some of my work in kindergarten"
Omen: "I can be even more"
Omen: "Can't go there"
Omen: "Good. Keep your focus"
Omen: "I will be their nightmare"
Jett: "Alright, I take back what I said about those bots. They're pretty good...and, so are you..."
Sova: "Be strong, Omen"
Yoru: "What brand are your knives, Jett? They're not 'Mammoth'. 'Segreto', maybe? I need one for my collection"
Sova: "Ready"
Yoru: "Embarrassing"
Sova: "Raze, you always work to lift our spirits. Thank you"
Omen: "You can finally let go"
Jett: "Just gotta play around the slow fields, and we're fine"
Sova: "Stay taut as a bowstring. The fight demands it"
Killjoy: "They look like us, but are they us? I have so many questions"
Yoru: "Who were you, ancestor? Where the hell did you go?!"
Omen: "I'll make them remember...they're only human"
Killjoy: "Keep you heads on"
Reyna: "As much as this world hurt me...it's mine...and I will kill to defend it"
Jett: "This is gonna be fun!"
Sova: "We all did our part!"
Breach: "Killjoy, your inventions are too fragile. See these arms? Carbon steel with titanium plating! That's what you need!"
Killjoy: "Wait, really?!"
Yoru: "I don't care if there are five of them or fifty of them. Let's go!"
Killjoy: "Turret destroyed"
Killjoy: "Placing alarmbot"
Omen: "History has already forgotten you"
Breach: "You never stop fighting, Viper. No matter what"
Omen: "Reyna, unleash your power"
Jett: "I'm gonna save"
Reyna: "You could never hope to match a Radiante!" ("You could never hope to match a Radiant!")
Sova: "Act on my intel. Don't give them time to reposition"
Breach: "Raze! Huh. Together again and we're not even breaking the law!"
Yoru: "That wasn't terrible"
Killjoy: "Had some trouble?"
Yoru: "The enemy Omen's like me. He'll try to get behind us. Watch your backs"
Killjoy: "Show us the way, Skye"
Jett: "Four"
Reyna: "You are so disappointing"
Breach: "We bring enough body bags?"
Killjoy: "Keep it cool. That's how you survive"
Killjoy: "Ugh, turret down"
Yoru: "That Killjoy's tech is everywhere! We're not at a science fair, get rid of that shit!"
Reyna: "Skye. This is just the beginning of your power"
Reyna: "Parasite"
Killjoy: "Reyna killed"
Sova: "Quiet now"
Omen: "Keep yourself together. You can't fall apart now"
Jett: "Skye. Ever though thought about making other summons? Like, uh, lions. Or...ooh, dragons!?"
Sova: "Their Breach has no patience at all. He attacks fast, be ready to move"
Breach: "Stomp 'em!"
Breach: "Kill everyone, and our job gets a whole lot easier"
Reyna: "What can I say. When I want something, I take it"
Sova: "It is done"
Reyna: *sighs* "This poor place. It clings to life. A city after my own heart"
Sova: "Death is cold, friend"
Jett: "Forge us a path, Skye. I'll be right behind ya"
Yoru: "So I saved the day. Don't make a big deal about it"
Yoru: "I'm done here"
Omen: "Keep hunting them down! Their Sage cannot protect them all"
Sova: "Enemy down"
Killjoy: "Reevaluate tactics"
Omen: "I can feel their panic rising. Drive it into them"
Killjoy: "Can I get this?"
Sova: "Sage, protect the others"
Breach: "Break through"
Omen: "It begins"
Yoru: "Sorry. This world's taken"
Sova: "Eyes on target"
Killjoy: "Alleyoop!"
Jett: "Aww, they tried"
Reyna: "Hush!"
Jett: "Careful of the edges! Not sure if I could catch you in time if you fell off. I mean, I'd try of course"
Breach: "The enemy Sage thinks she will slow us down. Haha! That's cute"
Breach: "Maybe now you'll take me seriously"
Omen: "My burden never ends"
Killjoy: "You stopped thinking clearly. This is for the best"
Breach: "I don't need these arms to fight, but they're fun. Might as well use 'em"
Omen: "I'm buying"
Killjoy: "Skye, you are so cool and collected, I'm almost jealous!"
Killjoy: "Last round to use our creds and abilities. Don't waste your firepower!"
Breach: "Child's play!"
Breach: "Their crew got sloppy. Punish them"
Yoru: "Find them, Sova. I'll do the rest"
Jett: "Give me those back"
Sova: "If we go easy on them, they will never learn"
Yoru: "One left"
Reyna: "You're nothing!"
Breach: "See, you're not too stubborn to die. You're just stubborn enough..."
Jett: "Let's end this"
Sova: "Be still"
Breach: "Gotchu"
Breach: "Just swapping in new fusion cells...okay, my arms are good! We can go"
Yoru: "Who let that old man out of the nursing home?"
Yoru: "I was the best? I'm shocked(!)"
Jett: "Three"
Killjoy: "Their stale tactics would only work for so long"
Sova: "Back to work"
Killjoy: "I'll show her who the real genius is"
Breach: "My rate just went up!"
Sova: "Stop their Breach at all costs"
Sova: "No more"
Reyna: "You're done"
Reyna: "I'd thought they'd have more to offer. How foolish of me..."
Killjoy: "Watch over us, Brimstone"
Reyna: "Such trash!"
Killjoy: "Look out for their rift walker"
Reyna: "I'm impressed, Sova. Even with blood on your hands you're keeping control"
Jett: "Damn right we're crushing it!"
Omen: "That was terrifying"
Killjoy: "It always feels like Reyna is after me personally. Does anyone else feel that way? Er, no? Just me...?"
Reyna: "Did you really expect that to work?"
Breach: "I could've left my arms at home"
Sova: "They sacrifice for nothing"
Sova: "Find their weakness"
Reyna: "You could never hope to match a Radiante!" ("You could never hope to match a Radiant!")
Breach: Breach laughs
Breach: "Didn't see me coming"
Killjoy: "One down!"
Omen: "Snuff them out"
Jett: "Sage, you lock 'em down, and I'll take them out. Just like we practiced"
Breach: "Not one left"
Jett: "This...is nothing"
Omen: "Kill their leader and the rest will flee like rats"
Sova: "One target left"
Jett: "Viper, be careful with that gas!"
Breach: "I go through anyone!"
Breach: "Attack us, come on!"
Yoru: "I'll pick them apart. You clean up whatever's left"
Breach: "Retired"
Yoru: "Never show weakness. Ever"
Breach: "They're not intimidating. They're stupid. Big difference"
Jett: "Oh, my back hurts! Everyone's so heavy!"
Breach: "Good take. Next one I'll take it all!"
Yoru: "How did every piece of trash end up on the same team?"
Killjoy: "I built literally everything on this battlefield. Ja, even the things that might kill us. What? You want me to say sorry?"
Killjoy: "Turret out"
Killjoy: "Who could've predicted this? Alright, I did"
Killjoy: "Placing sentry"
Killjoy: "Last round to use our creds and abilities. Don't waste your firepower!"
Breach: "Make it four"
Breach: "Ohh, I've missed the cold! This was great!"
Omen: "I already feel their hope dying and we haven't even begun. This will not take long"
Killjoy: "Drive them crazy, Raze! You're good at that..."
Omen: "I've reset the balance"
Breach: "Hell yeah! Who's up for another?"
Omen: "No more"
Sova: "Keep them cornered"
Killjoy: "Huh, looks like I was the smarter one"
Killjoy: "Had some trouble?"
Omen: "There is a Raze. I sense her laughter. Hmmm, to laugh again..."
Jett: "Clone killed"
Killjoy: "They have Sova over there too? Can someone um...steal his eye? What? I wanna see what it's recorded"
Omen: "Keep it together"
Reyna: "Ugh...I don't die so easily..."
Killjoy: "I anticipated us winning"
Killjoy: "Remember, your weapon is only a tool. You can't just shoot, you have to think!"
Omen: "There is...another of me? How many times did I get ripped apart? How many times did I die?"
Killjoy: "Calculated"
Sova: "Their winter has come. Bury them!"
Sova: "Never come back!"
Killjoy: "Be safe, Raze"
Reyna: "For you, hermanita" ("For you, little sister")
Jett: "One down"
Killjoy: "Oh, no no, you don't deserve my inventions"
Omen: "Sage, the life you give. Do you ever wonder where it's taken from?"
Reyna: "The sun is so bright. Don't worry. I'll kill him"
Omen: "Cut their walls down"
Omen: "I feel the strain. Block it out, Omen"
Omen: "Reyna, the souls you consume. Do you hear their voices as I do?"
Reyna: "Ah, what hope do these criaturas have? I almost pity them" ("Ah, what hope do these creatures have? I almost pity them")
Reyna: *laughs* "This is who I was meant to be!"
Breach: "Take 'em"
Reyna: "Next time I'll be on top"
Breach: "Saving"
Killjoy: "Swarm grenade out"
Reyna: "Don't insult me"
Reyna: "More, more!"
Jett: "Last one down"
Killjoy: "Relax. I've already thought of everything"
Omen: "Four dead"
Yoru: "Reyna, I'll take one side if you take the other. They'll be dead in five seconds"
Omen: "I will snuff out Phoenix's fire"
Killjoy: "Breach, I wish you'd take my extra reactor coolant. Ugh, if your arms overheat out there, don't blame me!"
Breach: "They think they're better than us. I can tell"
Omen: "What's another death..."
Omen: "We can't stumble now"
Sova: "Need a drop"
Breach: "Tremor!"
Omen: "Shameful performance"
Breach: "I'll run through you every damn time!"
Breach: "Damn, Jett, have you ever considered a life of crime? I have contacts. Let me know"
Reyna: *sighs* "Don't rush me"
Reyna: "I don't like your toys, Cypher. Don't spy on me"
Breach: "Always got to overprove myself!"
Sova: "Close one"
Sova: "Keep them cornered"
Breach: "Crush them"
Breach: "Always got to overprove myself!"
Omen: "Watch them falter"
Sova: "Three gone"
Jett: "They're not better than me"
Reyna: "That was a snack. I want a meal"
Sova: "Nowhere to run!"
Reyna: "The enemy only looks composed. Their hearts tell a different story"
Yoru: "Skye killed"
Jett: "Ayyy, the gang's all here! This is great, they don't stand a chance!"
Sova: "I am pleased"
Breach: "I'll make that Killjoy cry!"
Yoru: "Brimstone's dead"
Reyna: "Who's the hunter now?!"
Yoru: "That's it. Keep going!"
Yoru: "Who killed me? They're dead!"
Omen: "I'll kill that Omen. I'll take his memories. I will remember..."
Breach: "It could be worse, Brimstone! Instead of working together we could be facing off! Or maybe you'd prefer that..."
Jett: "Guys, come on. The spike!"
Sova: "Taken out"
Jett: "Wow, Sage! When you turn it on, you turn it on! Great work!"
Yoru: "It's impressive what Breach can do when he shuts up for a second"
Jett: "Yo, Killjoy? Think you could enhance my knives at some point? Maybe some lasers, homing tech...I-I'm just spitballing here"
Sova: "Buy all you need"
Reyna: "If that Brimstone is like ours, he's not going to quit. Let's make him retire, shall we?"
Breach: "Blasting!""
Omen: "Disappear"
Reyna: "Their head is in the guillotina, now pull!" ("Their head is in the guillotine, now pull!")
Breach: "Oh man, just awful(!) A tragedy(!)"
Yoru: "Good try, idiots"
Reyna: "I have lied, beaten, killed to survive. I will kill again and again if it means one more day"
Sova: "Take out their healer"
Killjoy: "We're not their equal"
Omen: "Well done, Skye! Nature's wrath indeed"
Yoru: "Headshot"
Breach: "Nice try"
Killjoy: "That Viper is so hateful, how could she even think straight?"
Sova: "Defeated"
Killjoy: "Viper, I'm speechless...and I always have something to say"
Breach: "Worthless!"
Omen: "Split. Ah, they don't know the meaning of the word"
Jett: "Do what you gotta do, Reyna"
Breach: "Dead"
Jett: "Let's fly"
Breach: "Raze, don't wreck this place all on your own! Hehe, save some demo for me!"
Yoru: "Anyone else?"
Killjoy: "Bot coming back"
Killjoy: "Got them all!"
Breach: "Phoenix keeps bringing the fire, it's like a Viking funeral!" *laughs*
Yoru: "Jump 'em!"
Jett: "You gotta retire sometime"
Killjoy: "Just cool down, we're good enough to win!"
Breach: "Weak"
Sova: "I'm not just an archer, you know"
Jett: "Watch out for Breach's impacts. It's hard to move after that"
Reyna: "Finished!"
Omen: "Their Sova thinks himself a hunter. What will he do when he feels me closing in?"
Yoru: "Hey, flower girl. I found some leaves. Do you want them?"
Yoru: "Keep hitting them"
Reyna: "They don't have a single life worth saving"
Omen: "Do you smell their panic?"
Breach: "Guns in my face? Just another Tuesday"
Yoru: "Four"
Killjoy: "Thanks bot!"
Sova: "I believe in all of you, like I believe in myself"
Breach: "This isn't a fight, it's stealing lunch money"
Jett: "Yikes, that sucks!"
Jett: "Yo, Brimstone! You know the drill. Just show me where to go"
Breach: "Hell yeah, let's go again!"
Breach: "Leave some fight for the rest of us, old man!"
Yoru: "Back off"
Jett: "There you are, you little shit"
Reyna: "They stopped breathing? Excellent. Then we're done"
Killjoy: "Ugh, okay, uh, where's Sage? This scheiße hurts" ("Ugh, okay, uh, where's Sage? This shit hurts")
Yoru: "Five enemies. Five for me, none for anyone else"
Omen: "Ugh, how many must I kill before I am restored. More, always more!"
Yoru: "You made them look like idiots, Jett. You should do that again"
Reyna: "Saving"
Yoru: "Show's over"
Killjoy: "Placing sentry"
Killjoy: "Their tech is only as good as their skill, and there, we have them beat!"
Breach: "Where the hell's the spike?"
Reyna: "They couldn't kill us. Now, they're dead"
Breach: "Their Sage is a coward hiding behind walls. Grow a spine already!"
Sova: "You cannot escape!"
Reyna: "What can I say. When I want something, I take it"
Breach: "Trust me, they'll know what hit 'em"
Reyna: "Bow before me!"
Breach: "I got robbed!"
Yoru: "That Viper really needs to die"
Jett: "Night night!"
Yoru: "Don't let them get up"
Yoru: "Bad luck"
Killjoy: "Strong results. Let's run it again"
Reyna: "Bleed them dry"
Killjoy: "Cypher, my condenser cables are missing from the lab again. Put them back please, thank you"
Reyna: "Raze dead"
Jett: *sighs* "This...is nothing"
Killjoy: "I can hold an area pretty well myself. Make sure to cover the angles I can't"
Killjoy: *laughs* "They're thinking so hard, I can smell their circuits frying"
Killjoy: *laughs* "Is this their best?!"
Sova: "Stay down"
Jett: "Okay, where's the straggler?"
Omen: "Strike at their weak points. If one link breaks the rest will follow"
Jett: "I have extra money if anyone needs"
Yoru: "Skye, you've been holding back"
Sova: "Rest"
Reyna: "Butchered!"
Reyna: "Need a drop"
Jett: "I'll find their Cypher"
Sova: "I'm saving"
Killjoy: "Got three!"
Reyna: "Don't worry, your life won't go to waste"
Yoru: "I'll fight anybody. I'll fight everybody"
Yoru: "Should I shoot them in the face, or stab them in the back? I'll decide later"
Jett: "Stay safe"
Jett: "Let's get these idiots"
Breach: "Freak!"
Jett: "Easy"
Reyna: "You should stop trying"
Omen: "Sage killed"
Omen: "Oh, there is a terrible beast inside you, Skye. Unleash it"
Yoru: "That Phoenix won't be smiling when I'm done with him"
Sova: "Now this is worth celebrating!"
Yoru: "That Cypher is a dead man"
Sova: "A fine death"
Yoru: "There's a Killjoy and her bots. So annoying..."
Reyna: "Keep your weapons. This heart is all I need"
Breach: "That Sova's mine"
Killjoy: "Cypher, let's keep sharing information. Every data point helps"
Breach: "No point saving. Spend it all"
Sova: "My babushka told me not to brag. But for this I make an exception!"
Reyna: "Next time I'll be on top"
Jett: "Oh look! They're desperate"
Breach: "Punch in"
Reyna: "Sova, be a dear and mind them for me"
Omen: "I am everywhere"
Breach: "Hit them fast, hit them hard"
Breach: "Shut up and let me work"
Reyna: "Ah, back where I belong"
Breach: "Game time!"
Sova: "Wherever they run, I will find them"
Omen: "Look for my shadows, they will hide you"
Omen: "Rest now. I will keep watch"
Reyna: "Ah, Viper, must you always play with your food?"
Breach: "Push 'em 'til they break!"
Yoru: "You tried to be a hero. Great job(!)"
Reyna: "My heart's racing!"
Sova: "Beat them back"
Sova: "Be at rest"
Omen: "It ends. For now"
Omen: "Kick them when they're down"
Reyna: "That cost them everything, and me? Well, nothing"
Killjoy: "Raze, freundin. If I see even a gyro out of place, I'm locking you out of my lab. My poor sentry bot..."
Killjoy: "Precise"
Reyna: "Thank you. I was starving!"
Jett: "I got your backs. Just...y'know...from the front"
Breach: "You got fire in your eyes, Phoenix. I like that"
Sova: "No more secrets"
Sova: "Down"
Omen: "You were a mistake"
Yoru: "Who's next?"
Omen: "Spend everything. We keep nothing"
Reyna: "Their Viper is terrifying. I love it!"
Jett: "I hate to say it but...probably best to play as a team. So, uh, what's the plan?"
Reyna: "Their Jett is playing hard to get. Alright, I'll play"
Killjoy: "Enemy down"
Omen: "The enemy fears you, Reyna. You can use that"
Omen: "Wait, what did you say? I'm hearing so many things..."
Sova: "Bullseye"
Sova: "A second wind. Let your senses come alive!"
Breach: "Buying"
Reyna: "Buying"
Reyna: "He won't fool me"
Sova: "At some point we'll have to get the spike"
Yoru: "No more games"
Jett: "Let's go"
Yoru: "Dead!"
Jett: "Aww, thought you'd try harder!"
Yoru: "Don't mess with me"
Killjoy: "Find the leverage, and wedge it open"
Yoru: "I already hear that Breach running his mouth. Don't tell me you'll punch me, just punch me!"
Killjoy: "The enemy Skye is here, but don't worry! My robotics will beat her organics every time!"
Reyna: "Ugh...I don't die so easily..."
Reyna: "I'll show that Brimstone true power!"
Jett: "Let that Sova find me, whatever. It'll help him look death in face"
Reyna: "Don't worry, your life won't go to waste"
Breach: "I'm feeling generous. Who needs a buy?"
Sova: "They tire. We don't"
Sova: "Track them down"
Reyna: "My heart's racing!"
Reyna: "Ah, the symphony of death. Don't worry, you get used to it"
Killjoy: "Cypher, can you show me round the dark web one of these days?"
Reyna: "They're starting to panic. I can feel their pulse quickening from here"
Killjoy: "Nature girl down"
Sova: "Save nothing"
Reyna: "Keep your weapons. This heart is all I need"
Breach: "I'm done playing"
Reyna: "Ah, back where I belong"
Yoru: "Reyna, with me"
Killjoy: "Deleted"
Sova: "Keep them in our sights"
Jett: "Ha, gottem!"
Breach: "A second Breach, huh? Huh. This might be a fair fight after all!"
Jett: "Think you can keep up? Who am I kidding? You know you can't keep up"
Sova: "Enemies close. Eyes up"
Breach: "We treat this like any other job. No more, no less"
Omen: "Just think, Sabine. You used to heal with your skill. Funny"
Reyna: "That should humble them"
Sova: "I'm gearing up"
Reyna: "Let's watch 'em struggle"
Sova: "A bow and arrow is old fashioned. But sometimes old ways are best"
Breach: "Game time!"
Reyna: "Breach killed"
Killjoy: "Oh, this is a much better trajectory!"
Breach: "Spend what you got"
Sova: "Is there no one left?"
Breach: "Stay out of my way"
Jett: "You? Outrun me?!"
Omen: "It is finished"
Sova: No one can beat our Phoenix!")
Jett: "Nailed them"
Reyna: "All dead, *scoffs*, and I'm still hungry"
Yoru: "You're done"
Omen: "Out of my way"
Omen: "Sad fools standing in our way"
Jett: "Finally. This is how I like to win"
Omen: "One more"
Sova: "What do you say, drone. Ready to stretch your wings?"
Yoru: "It's easiest if I sneak in and kill everyone. Don't make this complicated"
Jett: "Keep it up!"
Breach: "LET'S GO!"
Sova: "At your command, Brimstone"
Omen: "I will kill you, Omen"
Killjoy: *laughs* "Ah, my genius doesn't stop in the lab"
Sova: "Sova, I spared you when we first met. I can't let you go again"
Breach: "Cypher, stop bugging my gear with microphones! You're worse than Interpol!"
Yoru: "Dying, is for other people"
Sova: "You lack the patience, friend. Learn that first, then we'll approach strategy"
Reyna: "Ha! Let them rot!"
Killjoy: "We can't keep doing the same things"
Reyna: "Cypher buried"
Reyna: "Die meaningless"
Yoru: "Omen, let's teleport and spook those guys"
Yoru: "Nice, Reyna. I don't know why the rest of us are even here"
Sova: "Concentrate, Sova..."
Breach: "Don't let up"
Killjoy: "Good! One step closer to being back in pajamas"
Breach: "Too eager! Forgot the spike..."
Breach: "Too late"
Omen: "Sabine, look at the monsters we've become. At least you have flesh to hide your horror"
Sova: "Level heads until we're home, yes? Good"
Killjoy: "I know that Killjoy's tricks. Wait, she knows mine! Hah, finally, a challenge!"
Killjoy: "I knew it would all work out. It always does"
Breach: "I'm gonna run my fist through that Omen's face. Can you even punch a ghost? Who cares, I'm doing it!"
Breach: "Come on, come on..."
Sova: "Your justice frightens me, Viper. Is there no other way to find peace?"
Reyna: "Raze? Good. Never lose your voice"
Breach: "The faster we do this, the faster I get paid"
Yoru: "ざこ better watch their backs" ("Minnows better watch their backs")
Yoru: "Let's see what you've got, Sova"
Yoru: "Hm, their luck ran out"
Reyna: "Embarrassing"
Yoru: "Fine for now"
Killjoy: "Love my bots!"
Yoru: "Get out of my way!"
Jett: "Hell yeah, Brimstone! The best defense, is a good offense"
Reyna: "Oh I'm so ashamed(!). Pobre de mi, how will I live with myself(?)" ("Oh I'm so ashamed(!). Poor me, how will I live with myself(?)")
Killjoy: "Okay, that's done, time to lower this place"
Jett: "I know your tricks, wind girl. You're not faster than me!"
Reyna: "They're losing heart. I can feel it"
Jett: "You better run, Sova"
Yoru: "Send five more, we can do this again!!"
Jett: "Embarrassing!"
Omen: "Let go"
Killjoy: "There we go. Finally, cracking their code"
Reyna: "Somehow the hunger always lingers..."
Jett: "This is our home. Keep them out!"
Sova: "The winds shift in our favor"
Reyna: "Omen, shall we see who cuts quicker? No harm in a little competition"
Omen: "I can buy"
Killjoy: "My double's dead"
Sova: "I have survived more than they have ever seen"
Omen: "I'm curious, rift walker. When you travel, can you feel the pieces you leave behind?"
Yoru: "They forgot who they're dealing with"
Killjoy: "Go ahead! Call me tech support again!"
Yoru: "I'll show off next time"
Jett: "Four"
Sova: "A little recognition is nice, now and then. Thank you"
Killjoy: "Time for a field test"
Killjoy: "Skye, with a few genetic modifications, your animal flora could be even stronger. W-wait, was that offensive? Sorry..."
Killjoy: "Okay Raze, fine, your tinkering...may...have made my tech better. Nice work"
Yoru: "Killed their Cypher"
Sova: "I, am the hunter!"
Jett: "Where's that smile, Phoenix?"
Sova: "The cold air feels wonderful!"
Reyna: "Don't be cheap. Spend it all before it's gone"
Sova: "My quiver is never full"
Killjoy: "Wait, really?!"
Omen: "Hold our ground"
Omen: "I will get inside their inventor's head. Even brilliant minds will break to madness"
Breach: "Hell yeah! Next drink's on me"
Omen: "Still just human"
Omen: "Shadows traveling"
Breach: "OFF YOUR FEET!"
Jett: "What would you all do without me?"
Sova: "Brimstone! You are a true leader!"
Reyna: "Embarrass them"
Reyna: "Don't be cheap. Spend it all before it's gone"
Yoru: "You here to take my kills, Reyna? Let's make it a competition"
Killjoy: "Don't overthink it, that's my job"
Reyna: "Oh, do your little machines need help? Take your time. We Radiantes will start without you" ("Oh, do your little machines need help? Take your time. We Radiants will start without you")
Omen: "Their backs will be towards at least one of us"
Yoru: "Well they sucked"
Breach: "I hate waiting. Let's do this!"
Breach: "You're pathetic!"
Sova: "You've buried your secrets well, Cypher. But I am a hunter, and I will find them"
Killjoy: "They're all dead? I have more tests to run!"
Jett: "Just let them try to catch me"
Breach: "Concussing!"
Killjoy: "Flawless, what did they expect?" *laughs*
Yoru: "Wow. You really suck"
Sova: "I expected better of them"
Jett: "Knock 'em down, Breach"
Killjoy: "Turret out"
Sova: "I have money"
Breach: "Not your day, is it"
Sova: "You were nothing compared to the alpha!"
Reyna: "Not first? Disappointing"
Sova: "Clean"
Breach: "No match"
Sova: "Their Jett is fast! So are rabbits and squirrels. I hunt both"
Omen: "This is only the start"
Omen: "Make the right choice, even if it calls for sacrifice"
Jett: "I'm bored. Let's go"
Killjoy: "Let me just swipe those biometrics"
Yoru: "I'll take down their Viper"
Killjoy: "Found them"
Sova: "Never lose sight"
Killjoy: "If I'm not stressed, then you should not be stressed. I mean, look at me. Cool as a cucumber. *laughs* Ja, that's a thing Americans say, right?"
Jett: "Let's take what they have"
Reyna: "Death!" *laughs*
Breach: "Let's finish this already!"
Breach: "That pretty boy Sova sure looks the hero, I'll give him that. I'll still kill him"
Reyna: "Are those our enemies? Huh. This won't take long"
Breach: "Three out"
Yoru: "Don't look so smug, Phoenix!"
Reyna: "My city needs me. I can't be away for long. Let's end this quickly..."
Jett: "We're gonna win. No other option. Let's go"
Reyna: "I've stood over so many corpses. A few more, does not matter"
Breach: "Doubt me again!"
Jett: "No way, we're the same!"
Yoru: "Spend your money now. There's no bank in hell"
Jett: "I'm buying"
Yoru: "I'll turn this around"
Reyna: "We showed them their place. Now keep them there"
Killjoy: "Placing swarm grenade"
Killjoy: "I'm proud of that"
Reyna: "I'm the last thing they'll see before they die. Lucky them"
Jett: "Keep up"
Yoru: "I'm right here"
Jett: "This is fun. Who needs training dummies when you have real dummies!"
Breach: "Clearing out!"
Jett: "Hold those angles!"
Jett: "Reyna, damn! Even I couldn't keep up!"
Reyna: "If I act superior, it's because I am"
Yoru: "There are more answers here. I just have to find them"
Omen: "Let go"
Reyna: "Today is a gift to Radiants. We're finally free to use our power!"
Reyna: "Oi Jett, I remember being so young. It's good that you'll die before feeling old like me"
Killjoy: "You can trust my bots. They only malfunctioned that one time and, honestly, she won't miss that finger"
Omen: "Give them no ground"
Omen: "They think they know pain? They can't begin to comprehend it"
Breach: "Time to take these arms for a spin"
Breach: "That Brimstone better stay out of my way"
Sova: "Three gone"
Reyna: "Hello darling"
Yoru: "Pick something nice to kill them with. it's the least we can do"
Sova: "Put down"
Killjoy: "Bot assist"
Reyna: "You're nothing!"
Killjoy: "Auf Wiedersehen!" ("Goodbye!")
Jett: "Stay down!"
Omen: "It helps me focus! Oh, what do you care..."
Breach: "I hope you're ready, old man!"
Jett: "There's my bombshell! Crushed it, girl"
Yoru: "It seems your science shit has some use after all, Killjoy"
Sova: "Captain killed"
Killjoy: "There's a Viper over there. What a shame to rid the world of that mind. But I think she needs to rest"
Jett: "Ha! You should've seen your faces!"
Yoru: "Three"
Omen: "I'm saving"
Yoru: "I like you guys a lot better when we don't lose"
Sova: "Breach, we can only follow up if you wait for us. Nothing comes from rushing"
Breach: "Viper, you're enjoying this a little too much"
Jett: "Even fight? That's fun"
Reyna: "Phoenix killed"
Breach: "Ungh...I've taken worse..."
Omen: "Give in"
Sova: "I love you all"
Jett: "I know I dash around a lot, but I promise I'm looking out for y'all. Take them out while they're busy with me"
Killjoy: "Fwoof! Heiliger strohsack, this is crazy!" ("Fwoof! Holy crap, this is crazy!")
Omen: "I will take back what is mine"
Killjoy: "Don't stress if I die. It was great knowing you all. Also, delete my hard drive"
Omen: "I need nothing to win"
Killjoy: "Swarm grenades? Check. Killer robots? Check- oh, hah, don't worry. They're only killer when I say so"
Breach: "I'll destroy their Sage!"
Omen: "I need this"
Breach: "You're nothing"
Reyna: "What do you need?"
Jett: *sighs* "I could not have made that easier!"
Sova: "Today is not our day to die"
Reyna: "Out of my way!"
Jett: "Oops!"
Sova: "is that it?!"
Killjoy: "Impeccable kill"
Omen: "Fool"
Sova: "Tracked and hunted"
Reyna: "Be grateful I killed you quickly"
Jett: "Wind, show me where to go"
Sova: "May the wind guide your blades, Jett...and my arrows"
Killjoy: "Trapped and zapped!"
Killjoy: "Aww, they should stop playing checkers"
Yoru: "I'm back"
Yoru: "Call me when the world ends again. I'd hate to miss it"
Omen: "There is a fury in you, Sova. It is terrible. Beautiful"
Jett: "Aaaand the spike's still in base"
Jett: "Nice, killed it!...and them. We definitely killed them"
Jett: "Good work! Don't screw it up"
Killjoy: *laughs* "Ah, my genius doesn't stop in the lab"
Reyna: "Light the way, Phoenix"
Breach: "Enough"
Yoru: "I'm leaving now. See you at the next apocalypse"
Reyna: "It's playtime"
Yoru: "Let's strike first. it's better than having to strike back"
Jett: "Okay, where's the straggler?"
Killjoy: "Imagine if I died, right now. So funny..."
Jett: "Huh! Who are you all? The cleanup crew?"
Sova: "Eyes up"
Reyna: "They're nothing to me!"
Yoru: "You died last. Good job(!)"
Breach: "They can run, or get run over. Their choice"
Breach: "The fight is over?! I just warmed up!"
Killjoy: "Trapped and zapped!"
Reyna: "Finished"
Reyna: "Ah, those fools just wasted their advantage"
Omen: "Pitiful"
Breach: "Is that the best you've got?"
Jett: "We lose everything after this. Spend it"
Breach: "Look at this place! Kingdom has more money than they know what to do with! I wonder where they keep it..."
Killjoy: "Get them, Reyna!"
Yoru: "The dimensional fabric here is thin. I'll tear through"
Jett: "Let's blow them over"
Reyna: "I like the way you work, Breach. Violento. Me gusta" ("I like the way you work, Breach. Violent. I like it")
Yoru: "Move in after I strike. That's when they're weak"
Sova: "I have money"
Reyna: "They have no idea how heartless I am"
Jett: "Was that supposed to be a fight?"
Breach: "Shut up and let me work"
Sova: "Stay on their trail"
Breach: "The angel's dead"
Omen: "What would you have become, Skye? Ugh, it doesn't matter now"
Sova: "Do not hunt the hunter"
Jett: "Alright, I'll take it, I'll take it..."
Yoru: "That was good, Omen. Smile"
Killjoy: "Okay, Skye. Get us to a good position, then I'll lock it down"
Omen: "Three killed"
Reyna: "Who will heal their healer?"
Reyna: "Poor wretch"
Reyna: "Feels good, doesn't it? Now do it again!"
Sova: "Беги, Sova" ("Run, Sova")
Reyna: "Deep breaths everyone. Your hearts are pounding"
Reyna: "Die!"
Reyna: "At least they kept it interesting"
Reyna: "Saving"
Killjoy: "Brimstone, remember your screen isn't frozen, it's just locked. And no, the internet isn't down. *sigh* It's never down..."
Killjoy: "Who's up, for a debrief!? Anyone? No one?"
Jett: "I'll show you scary, Omen"
Yoru: "Pathetic"
Yoru: "If you're gonna buy a gun, then shoot me"
Breach: "I'm firing on all cylinders!"
Breach: "Come on! Get me in the line of fire"
Sova: "Don't be afraid. I've gone through rifts before"
Breach: "Flash out"
Reyna: "Insecto" ("Insect")
Sova: "Sleep, brother"
Sova: "Shot down"
Jett: "Oh, I'm hungry. Anyone hungry? Lunch on Brimstone after this!"
Reyna: "Peekaboo!"
Reyna: "You were barely worth the effort"
Killjoy: "Killed my bot"
Breach: "You see an insect, you crush it"
Breach: "Easy!"
Breach: "I take what I want"
Yoru: "Miss me?"
Omen: "Annihilated"
Breach: "Oh yeah, there's the adrenaline"
Killjoy: "Power's out"
Sova: "Silence"
Yoru: "きたらてろ" ("Come on")
Sova: "Вот это да. No one can beat our Phoenix!" ("Wow. No one can beat our Phoenix!")
Yoru: "Just try and get past me"
Breach: "Popped!"
Breach: "Come on, come on..."
Jett: "Oh, my back hurts! Everyone's so heavy!"
Omen: "Removed"
Reyna: "How did we forget the spike?"
Killjoy: "That's done"
Jett: "Your fault!"
Breach: "They don't get to surrender, keep swinging!"
Reyna: "We are ready for them"
Sova: "No one escapes my sight. No one"
Reyna: "Enough of your technology! The future is Radiant!"
Omen: "You think you can kill me?"
Reyna: "See you on the front lines, Phoenix. Save some enemies for me"
Sova: "Die"
Reyna: "Let's remind them who we are"
Killjoy: "I've got money, need something?"
Killjoy: "Ugh, turret down"
Killjoy: "Brim, have you considered embedding your bracer in your limb? I can do that you know..."
Jett: "Ha! We crushed them!"
Breach: "Dead"
Sova: "Leave them no escape!"
Killjoy: "Ha, turret killed them"
Breach: "Hit them back!"
Sova: "I will put their Viper down. It is mercy"
Yoru: "Okay, Phoenix. Don't be upset when you get less kills than me"
Reyna: "If I act superior, it's because I am"
Reyna: "Hello darling"
Omen: "I'm buying"
Omen: "We don't have the spike!"
Breach: "I don't have all day"
Yoru: "They should give up now, save us the effort"
Killjoy: "Alarmbot out"
Sova: "I'm saving"
Sova: "Neutralized"
Omen: "I will find you, Omen"
Sova: "Why are they so determined to die?"
Jett: "Maybe their Killjoy isn't as smart as ours. I don't wanna deal with her if she is"
Breach: "Phoenix, burn 'em down"
Reyna: "I will drain the life from our pray. That's all they're good for"
Sova: "This will do"
Sova: "In the wild, fire means life. You be our fire, Phoenix"
Killjoy: "I evaluated their strategy. It's a joke!"
Breach: "Don't aim that camera at me, Cypher! Save it for the enemy"
Sova: "I was told you are all the best. That is why I'm here"
Yoru: "Let's end this"
Omen: "Who will they cry for, once they know they're going to die?"
Omen: "Tear them apart, rift walker"
Reyna: "Enough of your technology! The future is Radiant!"
Omen: "Teleport stopped!"
Jett: "I would make fun of their dumb faces, but they're us! Huh, we look stupid"
Killjoy: "Alarmbot out"
Reyna: "They stopped breathing? Excellent. Then we're done"
Reyna: "Gentle Sage is not so gentle after all"
Breach: "These cowards aren't ready for me. No one ever is"
Yoru: "You all have guns. Now use them!"
Killjoy: *laughs* "Oh, okay"
Omen: "Killed"
Killjoy: "Okay, I put together some data on our last six combat missions. Did you read it? Did anyone...read it? Oh God...can anyone here read?"
Reyna: "This enemy's nothing special. Still human, still mortal"
Breach: "They think they're so secure"
Jett: "This place is nice, but not nice enough to die in. Let's win and get outta here"
Breach: "Keep up the pressure"
Omen: "I know how this will end"
Omen: "Killed their Skye"
Reyna: "Time for them to kneel"
Yoru: "That's me over there! Great, now I can kick my own ass"
Yoru: "Why did they bring Sage? Now they have to die twice. Idiots"
Breach: "That monk thinks she's an angel. Let's clip her wings"
Jett: "Need a drop"
Sova: "Repel them"
Killjoy: "Perfect accuracy"
Sova: "The snow should hide our tracks. We were never here..."
Killjoy: "Everyone makes fun of German efficiency, haha. Just keep laughing as you use all my gear..."
Jett: "Oh no!"
Killjoy: "Good"
Yoru: "This neighborhood used to be so much better without this Kingdom shit"
Sova: "Thank you, Omen. Startled prey is easier to hunt"
Yoru: "I'm afraid this might get rough"
Yoru: "Killed them"
Killjoy: "Thanks botty!" *laughs*
Breach: "I'm feeling generous. Who needs a buy?"
Killjoy: "No more Sova"
Omen: "Cower, run"
Reyna: "That was a snack. I want a meal"
Omen: "I can buy"
Reyna: "That cost them everything, and me? Well, nothing"
Omen: "Four dead"
Omen: "Their fear blinds them"
Jett: "Cool. Let's go"
Reyna: "No prisoners"
Jett: "Cypher, just tell me where they are. I'll do the rest"
Breach: "They're not getting the message. leave it to me, I'll rough them up"
Reyna: "Parasite"
Breach: "Keep them off balance!"
Yoru: "I'll handle this!"
Omen: "Begone"
Reyna: "They're just batteries...and I need a recharge"
Sova: "I'm done with Cypher's secrets"
Breach: "Anyone else want to try me?!"
Omen: "Their nightmare is becoming real"
Reyna: "If I act superior, it's because I am"
Breach: "Three out"
Jett: "Woo, okay, we know the drill. Stick to your roles and we'll crush it"
Sova: "I've survived much worse than you"
Breach: "It was never personal, Viper. Just business"
Breach: "You flinch, you lose"
Jett: "Yikes!"
Yoru: "Good luck, Skye"
Reyna: "Enough"
Sova: "Jett, fly safe"
Reyna: "Sage, we are the perfect pair. You give life. I take it"
Killjoy: "Anticipated"
Jett: "Phoenix, yo! That was insane!"
Reyna: "I remember the machines Killjoy made. What they did to-...never mind, it does not matter!"
Breach: "I need a drop"
Omen: "I will break the balance"
Breach: "It's you and me, Raze"
Yoru: "I'm back"
Sova: "This bow has taken man and beast alike. I have found there is little difference"
Breach: "We got them beat. Knock 'em out!"
Jett: "There you are"
Yoru: "Anyone gonna get the spike?"
Breach: "Just tell me where they are, Sova. I'll take it from there"
Breach: "I've been itching for a fight"
Reyna: "Pathetic!"
Killjoy: "I'll stop that Breach"
Breach: "We ran right over them!"
Yoru: "They want more of me? Fine"
Jett: "Grounded"
Sova: "You should pay more attention"
Reyna: "How sad. You're just like everyone else"
Killjoy: "Alarmbot down"
Breach: "I'll do my job, you do yours"
Reyna: *sighs* "Don't rush me"
Reyna: "Be grateful I killed you quickly"
Killjoy: "Is everyone's tech still working? Double check it please"
Breach: "If that Sova thinks an arrow will stop me, he's got another thing coming...my fist!" *laughs*
Reyna: "I was not meant for this climate, let's go!"
Yoru: "Stop trying"
Sova: "The best of the best and we still forget the spike"
Killjoy: "Have to keep it fun, you know?"
Killjoy: "Placing alarmbot"
Breach: "Been pulling jobs like this for years. Risky? Sure. But never boring"
Omen: "I must hold together"
Jett: "Hey Phoenix, if you die, I call dibs on your jacket"
Reyna: "Take everything"
Jett: "Aww, can't res yourself?"
Killjoy: "Tactics beat firepower. Use that"
Reyna: "Take control"
Omen: "Experiment complete"
Sova: "None escape me"
Breach: "Ha!"
Jett: *sighs* "Cool"
Breach: "Get off my back"
Yoru: "ざこが" ("This minnow..")
Sova: "Their Reyna prepares on the other side. Kill her before she becomes monstrous"
Killjoy: "Initiated!"
Reyna: "You were pitiful"
Sova: "Nice shot"
Reyna: *sighs* "Don't rush me"
Sova: "Be at peace, my friend"
Reyna: "They want to die? Let them"
Breach: "Reyna, I think I'm in love!" *laughs*
Killjoy: "I didn't realize we had two geniuses on the team!"
Reyna: "Look your enemy in the eye. It helps with accuracy"
Breach: "Stand in my way. I dare you"
Yoru: "Spend your money now. There's no bank in hell"
Jett: "Could've been first if I tried"
Reyna: "We win, we survive"
Breach: "Ha!"
Breach: "Headshot"
Killjoy: "Like clockwork"
Omen: "Can't even remember the spike"
Sova: "Pick them off"
Killjoy: *tuts* "You tried"
Sova: "Lead us to victory, Brimstone"
Jett: "We get a pick, we move in. Got it?"
Omen: "Three killed"
Breach: "You're just a pretender"
Reyna: "Break them"
Yoru: "Idiot!"
Reyna: "Stay alive! I want their life, not yours"
Breach: "Keep up!"
Breach: "So long as it's leg day!" *laughs*
Breach: "Get off my back"
Reyna: "Killjoy is an offense to my Radiance. I'll break her apart!"
Sova: "Okay, that is done"
Omen: "Wait until I blind them to strike"
Omen: "Don't die here, Sabine. I need your secrets"
Reyna: "Ha! Let them rot!"
Sova: "Gone"
Sova: "Protect our motherland!"
Jett: "Race you to the spike sites!"
Reyna: "What can I say. When I want something, I take it"
Jett: "Use everything you have, we lose it anyway"
Yoru: "Anyone else think they can kill a god?"
Jett: "Their Jett has nothin' on me. I got her"
Omen: "A Radiant healer is with them. I can feel her pull against the natural balance"
Omen: "Oh, what's another death..."
Reyna: "Their lives are so meaningless. Might as well give them to me"
Reyna: "It doesn't matter what this place used to be. Now it's just another graveyard"
Breach: "So the German has some fancy toys. Let's break them!"
Omen: "Hush"
Sova: "Now four"
Yoru: "Get them out of here"
Reyna: "Not first? Disappointing"
Sova: "The pack survives!"
Omen: "To dust"
Jett: like just yesterday I was chopping Korean wild chive at the store. Wonder if that place is still standing...")
Omen: "I'm saving"
Jett: "Don't stress. I'm super quiet"
Killjoy: "Found them"
Killjoy: "Headshot"
Jett: "Let's take at least one down with us!"
Omen: "Die"
Omen: "I'll silence their Breach"
Yoru: "Double's dead"
Reyna: "You were barely worth the effort"
Sova: "I'll tear through you all!"
Yoru: "Hey! You forgot the spike!"
Jett: "Are they asleep?"
Killjoy: "If this town had let me install my defense matrix we wouldn't have to be here! Ugh, oh well, I'll clean this up myself"
Jett: "I'm gonna save"
Yoru: "Shut up!"
Jett: "Keep it up. Screw up, and they're on us!"
Yoru: "Three"
Yoru: "Last Yoru standing wins"
Killjoy: "Can I get this?"
Reyna: "They're nothing to me!"
Breach: "I fight dirty"
Breach: "I'm in overdrive!"
Sova: "It was you, or me"
Jett: "You can't catch us!"
Omen: "Jett, you were a storm. Well done"
Omen: "They are no match for you, rift walker. Not even close"
Omen: "That was fun"
Killjoy: "They should probably reevaluate their approach"
Omen: "Shameful performance"
Reyna: "It's playtime"
Yoru: "It's my Earth. Now get out!"
Breach: "If you're not being shot at you're doing something wrong!"
Breach: "My rate just went up!"
Reyna: "What do you need?"
Sova: "You all are wonderful!"
Yoru: "Thanks for helping me take out the trash"
Yoru: "Don't stop fighting. You must keep going, even if you are the only one"
Sova: "Come, into the unknown!"
Killjoy: "Your creations were too primitive"
Killjoy: "Okay everyone, take a test tube. Thank you. Let's collect samples and get out of here"
Sova: "Let us hunt"
Breach: "Saving"
Yoru: "Phoenix! Don't get blood on that jacket"
Yoru: "One left"
Breach: "I'm here to make money, not spend it"
Reyna: "It's playtime"
Reyna: "Ay corazón" ("Oh sweetheart")
Reyna: "Don't insult me"
Reyna: "Happy hunting, Omen"
Sova: "Take out Cypher's cameras. He's weak when he's blind"
Breach: "Let's put them in the ground"
Sova: "Killjoy is no threat without her toys. Break them and remove her"
Killjoy: "Now four!"
Omen: "I need this"
Sova: "You have me. That is good for you"
Reyna: "Phoenix killed"
Killjoy: "Everyone note down your observations, then let's run it again"
Reyna: "I'd thought they'd have more to offer. How foolish of me..."
Killjoy: "Good. Analyze, then improve"
Yoru: "Even I can't beat me"
Jett: "Party's over"
Killjoy: "Tag teamed"
Yoru: "Dead is a good look for you"
Killjoy: "I'll get that spooky ghost boy!"
Killjoy: "The enemy Raze's tech is just spare parts and duct tape. It's a wonder she hasn't blown herself up..."
Omen: "I must endure"
Killjoy: "These imposters actually think they can beat my tech? Ah, let's test that theory"
Sova: "Brimstone, after we win, I'll buy you a drink if you share a memory with us"
Reyna: "You are so disappointing"
Sova: "We can end it now. Once more!"
Sova: "On target"
Reyna: "Poor, miserable criaturas" ("Poor, miserable creatures")
Sova: "They should've dug a deeper grave"
Yoru: "Raze, remember this is a covert mission. At least try not to give us away"
Reyna: "Someone else will clean up. I don't take out the trash"
Reyna: "You should stop trying"
Reyna: "Ugh, I can't deal with the morality of yet another Brimstone! The hipocresía! I'll silence him" ("Ugh, I can't deal with the morality of yet another Brimstone! The hypocrisy! I'll silence him")
Jett: "Oof!"
Yoru: "So much fuss over nothing. Someone get me a bat, I'll finish this"
Sova: "Goodbye, Cypher. You will not be missed"
Sova: "I'll find them"
Killjoy: *laughs* "I knew this would be easy but...meine güte!" (*laughs* "I knew this would be easy but...my goodness!")
Jett: "Wow, so embarrassing!"
Jett: "Keep up"
Omen: "Do you see under my hood, Cypher? Does it scare you?"
Breach: "Hehe, of course you still need me"
Jett: "Three"
Breach: "Night-night"
Omen: "Put them to sleep"
Breach: "Nerd!"
Breach: "Omen! That scared the shit out of me!"
Omen: "Skye the life weaver. The power to create, to destroy. Which path will you embrace, I wonder?"
Yoru: "Help that old man find his grave"
Jett: "Huh, oh wow. You guys suck"
Yoru: "Now they've pissed me off!"
Omen: "I feel like myself. Catch them. Again"
Sova: "Concentrate, Sova..."
Omen: "Gutted"
Yoru: "Give them nothing!"
Sova: "They demand a fight. Who are we to disobey?"
Breach: "Time to go home. Scrape these bugs off my boots"
Breach: "Haha, when that Brimstone sees me here, he's gonna be soooo pissed!"
Omen: "You thought you could escape my nightmare?!"
Sova: "No chance"
Reyna: "It's playtime"
Reyna: "You were pitiful"
Breach: "I always do the heavy lifting!"
Jett: "Time to mix things up"
Yoru: "Try not to die"
Yoru: "The enemy Skye is here. I never liked the zoo"
Sova: "Thug"
Jett: Jett scoffs
Sova: "We are strong because we are together. Don't forget that"
Jett: "Healer down"
Killjoy: "Got three!"
Omen: "Pity the man who dies meaningless"
Sova: "I'm not tired. Are you?"
Reyna: "I don't care how bright you are! You'll never be a Radiant!"
Sova: "Watch them run when lit by my sonar. That's when we strike"
Breach: "Job's done! Pay up"
Killjoy: "Killed my bot"
Jett: *laughs* "You're terrible!"
Omen: "Where should we go, rift walker? They cannot watch everywhere at once"
Killjoy: "Once we win, just dump all your tech in my lab. I'll fix it up"
Killjoy: "Be smarter"
Breach: "Brimstone, the corporate sellout! Here to look out for Kingdom's special interests?"
Reyna: "Someone else will clean up. I don't take out the trash"
Omen: "Raze, sew your chaos"
Omen: "They fear death, they should fear so much more than that"
Killjoy: "That rift boy is going to teleport himself right into one of my traps"
Reyna: "Did you really expect that to work?"
Breach: "That Brimstone can't stop me"
Breach: "Mow 'em down!"
Reyna: "Adiós" ("Goodbye")
Omen: "Five dead"
Reyna: "Enough with the robots, I want their maker"
Yoru: "Omen, let's flank them"
Reyna: "You see? They're flawed. Ordinary"
Reyna: "Raze dead"
Jett: "Aww. Was that important?"
Omen: "You didn't see that coming"
Breach: "Okay Omen, I'll smash in the front door while you sneak in the back. It's a good plan, yeah?"
Killjoy: "Their eyes are down"
Killjoy: "Bot coming back"
Jett: "Breach, my man!"
Jett: "I'm buying"
Sova: "Back to work"
Breach: "Takes more than that..."
Yoru: "These guys caught me in a mood. Bad luck for them"
Reyna: *sighs* "Don't rush me"
Breach: "I need a drop"
Omen: "You forget your place"
Reyna: "If you've never seen a massacre, this is what it looks like"
Killjoy: "Ha, turret killed them"
Killjoy: "Brimstone, that was wonderful!"
Reyna: "Be strong, Skye"
Jett: "They're supposed to be fighting back, right?"
Killjoy: "Placing swarm grenade"
Yoru: "Die"
Jett: "Looks like I was the stronger one"
Reyna: "How sad. You're just like everyone else"
Killjoy: "Now four!"
Reyna: "They forget their place"
Breach: "Sova's dead"
Yoru: "うるせんだよ" ("Annoying")
Yoru: "Huh, not bad"
Jett: "Be faster"
Jett: "Sweet, that went well! Alright, same thing this time"
Sova: "You'll have your intel. I promise"
Yoru: "If I kill all the enemies myself, I apologize. I have trouble sharing"
Omen: "Claw through them"
Yoru: "Stop trying"
Killjoy: "Finished"
Killjoy: "Alarmbot down"
Jett: "Get out"
Sova: "No more to oppose us"
Omen: "Their spike is defused"
Reyna: "I don't care how bright you are! You'll never be a Radiant!"
Omen: "One more"
Jett: "I'm amped! Let's go! I got things to do"
Yoru: "くそ!" ("Shit!")
Breach: "Make it four"
Omen: "Erase their Skye"
Omen: "No more meddling"
Omen: "I am the beginning. I am the end"
Reyna: "Okay, Jett. Time to fly"
Jett: "Enemy killed"
Sova: "You failed. Now flee"
Jett: "Do it again!"
Killjoy: "It feels bad to kill that Brimstone. I mean I will. Just feels bad"
Sova: "Good. Next time, better"
Omen: "Hold on to this moment. We can't stop here"
Sova: "Overtake them"
Jett: "Duck!"
Reyna: "Stamp out their last breath"
Sova: "Viper. For a scientist, you are very violent"
Sova: "They aren't impervious. We can do this!"
Jett: "Headshot"
Yoru: "I guess working with a team isn't that bad"
Killjoy: "Ugh, do I have to attach legs to the spike now?"
Killjoy: "Fish in a barrel"
Jett: "Aww, sorry pretty boy!"
Killjoy: "Don't interrupt my work"
