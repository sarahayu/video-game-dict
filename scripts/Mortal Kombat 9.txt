SHAO KAHN: Where are the Elder Gods, Raiden?
SHAO KAHN: Their pathetic Mortal Kombat shackles me no longer.
SHAO KAHN: They masquerade as dragons, but are mere toothless worms.
SHAO KAHN: My venom spreads. It is the end of all things.
SHAO KAHN: Armageddon.
RAIDEN: STOP!
SHAO KAHN: It is done.
SHAO KAHN: Your time has passed.
SHAO KAHN: Ages wasted in foolish resistance.
SHAO KAHN: Now is the dawn of my rule.
SHAO KAHN: Yes. Pray to the worms, Raiden. As your world ends...
RAIDEN: He must win!
LIU KANG: Lord Raiden! What is wrong?
RAIDEN: Strange visions...
LIU KANG: Your amulet!
RAIDEN: It is nothing, Liu Kang. The tournament begins.
SHANG TSUNG: Kombatants. I am Shang Tsung! In the coming days each of you will fight. Some are here of their own volition, others were brought here by chance...
JOHNNY CAGE: Hey, beautiful. Johnny Cage.
SONYA: Good for you.
JOHNNY CAGE: What? "Massive Strike", "Citizen Cage", "Ninja Mime"? None of those ring a bell?
SONYA: Kano...
JOHNNY CAGE: "Kano"? Wasn't in that one...
SHANG TSUNG: You participate in the most important Mortal Kombat in history! This tournament, the tenth after nine Outworld victories, will determine Earthrealm's fate. If you defeat all of your opponents, you will face one final challenge... me.
JOHNNY CAGE: Huh! That old geezer's the final challenge? They might as well give me the belt right now. They do have belts, right?
JOHNNY CAGE: What? How did you--
SHANG TSUNG: Appearances can be deceiving.
SHANG TSUNG: Our first kombatant will be Mr. Cage!
JOHNNY CAGE: That's right! That's right! Who's it gonna be?
SHANG TSUNG: Reptile!
JOHNNY CAGE: Nice stunt! Who's your agent?
SHANG TSUNG: Begin!
JOHNNY CAGE: All right, it's showtime!
JOHNNY CAGE: He got Caged! That's it, ha haa! Oh yeah! I'm so pretty!
JOHNNY CAGE: And I'm takin' you down, I'm takin' you down, I'm takin' you out, I'm takin' you out, and I'm taking you out...
JOHNNY CAGE: ...for dinner!
SHANG TSUNG: Your second challenge, Mr. Cage. Baraka!
JOHNNY CAGE: Hmmm, ok... Nice makeup, but is it really necessary?
JOHNNY CAGE: Woah!
BARAKA: They will taste your flesh!
JOHNNY CAGE: Man, I love those blades! My producer has got to meet you! We're doing "Tommy Scissorfists", and--
SHANG TSUNG: Congratulations, Mr. Cage. Now, FINISH HIM!
JOHNNY CAGE: Finish him? Yeah, right!
SHANG TSUNG: Kill him!
JOHNNY CAGE: Woah! Woah, woah, wait a second! I'm not gonna kill anyone!
SHANG TSUNG: Very well.
SHANG TSUNG: The tournament will resume at dawn!
JOHNNY CAGE: What, that's it? Really?
JOHNNY CAGE: Now where'd that hottie go?
RAIDEN: You fought well.
JOHNNY CAGE: Thanks. Nice hat.
LIU KANG: You should be more respectful of Lord Raiden. He is the protector of Earthrealm, the God of Thunder, the--
JOHNNY CAGE: Look, I don't know what kind of role-playing you guys are into, but count me out.
LIU KANG: This tournament is more than a chance for personal glory. We are fighting for the very survival of Earthrealm.
JOHNNY CAGE: What are you talking about?
RAIDEN: Your last opponent was Tarkatan. He was born with those blades.
JOHNNY CAGE: Yeah, those things are real.
RAIDEN: He represents Outworld. Had you lost, the emperor Shao Kahn would have come one step closer to physically absorbing our world into his.
JOHNNY CAGE: Outworld, yeah right, right...
RAIDEN: The Elder Gods created the Mortal Kombat tournament to give Earthrealm a chance to defend itself. But if we lose this time, Shao Kahn will conquer all.
JOHNNY CAGE: Dun Dun Dunnn!
JOHNNY CAGE: Look guys, I'm an actor. I save the world for the cameras. If this emperor is really a threat, call the military. Me, I've got a date with a blonde. Ciao!
LIU KANG: What do you see in him?
RAIDEN: He is a hero, Liu Kang, though he may not yet know it.
COMMAND: Triangulating your signal for evac, but...
COMMAND: ...there is no island.
SONYA: I'm standing on it! Just lock onto my wrist comm!
COMMAND: Understood. What is your current status?
SONYA: They have Jax. And if I don't fight in this crazy tournament, they'll kill him. I'm gonna try to--
JOHNNY CAGE: Need help? I specialise in rescuing damsels in distress.
SONYA: You again. Listen, I've got serious problems here. I'm in no mood to be hit on by some movie star.
JOHNNY CAGE: C'mon. A girl like you shouldn't be wandering around this freak show alone.
JOHNNY CAGE: Look, baby, I can't let you run loose without an escort.
SONYA: I don't need an escort, and I'm sure as hell not your baby!
JOHNNY CAGE: Ha haaa! Not bad for a... girl...
JOHNNY CAGE: Look, sorry about that.
SONYA: I don't need your help.
JOHNNY CAGE: Fine. Have it your way. I'll just leave you to your... problems.
KANO: Good idea!
KANO: Now that he's softened you up, it's my turn!
SONYA: Not man enough for a fair fight?
KANO: I don't do "fair".
KANO: No need to get up, love.
KANO: So tell me...how are things at Command?
SONYA: Bastard!
KANO: Guillible bitch. Just had to point you in the wrong direction. Couldn'ta done it without ya!
SONYA: S.F. is on the way. You won't get far.
KANO: Oh, I got a knack for survival. You, on the other hand, are gonna die here.
JOHNNY CAGE: Step away from the lady!
JOHNNY CAGE: Fans think my moves are all wire work and special effects. Truth is... I AM the special effects.
JOHNNY CAGE: Throw that on your... barby... Shrimp...
SONYA: Thanks.
JOHNNY CAGE: No problem. Who is that guy anyway?
SONYA: His name's Kano. He was an informant in our Black Dragon investigation. Big-time arms dealers. Turns out he was their leader and giving us the runaround. Lot of our guys got killed because of him.
JOHNNY CAGE: So that's not a costume? You're actual military?
SONYA: Special Forces.
JOHNNY CAGE: Get out! So you know about this "threat to the world" stuff, right? Raiden called in the cavalry.
SONYA: Raiden? No idea who you're talking about.
SONYA: Damn.
JOHNNY CAGE: He can't be far.
SONYA: He'll have to wait.
SONYA: I appreciate your help, Cage.
JOHNNY CAGE: Johnny.
SONYA: But right now I've got things to take care of. My C.O. is locked up on this island somewhere. I have to find him.
SONYA: Jax! Jax, are you in here?
SONYA: Oh my God. What did they do to you?
JAX: Run, girl, run...
SHANG TSUNG: Miss Blade! You do not disappoint. I have been expecting you.
SONYA: Let him go! We're not part of your tournament!
SHANG TSUNG: On the contrary, you are very much a kontestant. You will face Sub-Zero, of the Lin Kuei clan of assassins.
SUB-ZERO: Now you will feel death's cold embrace.
SONYA: Done! We're leaving!
SONYA: Stand in my way and I'll kick your a--
SHANG TSUNG: A challenge?
RAIDEN: No. You will not be the one to challenge Shang Tsung.
SONYA: You want some too? Fine by me!
SONYA: Enough of this!
RAIDEN: Shield your eyes.
SONYA: What?
RAIDEN: Shield your eyes.
SONYA: Jax, come on! We're outta here!
JAX: 'Bout time...
SHANG TSUNG: You aided their escape.
RAIDEN: You allowed them to escape.
SHANG TSUNG: They will not get far.
SONYA: Come on Jax! Move it! That's an order!
JAX: Oh... so you're in charge now?
SONYA: Special Forces Command, this is Sonya Blade! Where's that evac?
COMMAND: Blade, they are en-route... coming to you shortly...
SONYA: Affirmative! Almost home, soldier.
KITANA: By order of Shang Tsung, no one leaves this island.
SONYA: I don't have time for this. Outta my way!
SONYA: Sure don't need anymore surprises like them.
SONYA: How are you holding up?
JAX: I'm fine.
SONYA: Liar. After I get you to base, I'm coming back. Kano's still here somewhere.
JAX: Your obsession with him is gonna get you killed.
SONYA: I trusted him.
JAX: Yeah, we all did.
SONYA: But I was the one he used.
SONYA: I think our ride's here.
SONYA: No!
SONYA: Damn you!
SHANG TSUNG: You have a challenger - Kano.
KANO: Pretty Boy ain't gonna save ya this time.
SONYA: You're comin' with me.
SHANG TSUNG: Kano is not your prisoner.
SONYA: At least help Jax. He needs a medic!
SONYA: Bastard.
JOHNNY CAGE: There she is!
JOHNNY CAGE: Sonya! You all right? Hey, looks like you found 'im.
JOHNNY CAGE: S'up, Sarge?
SONYA: He's a ma--
SONYA: Hey, what are you doing?
JOHNNY CAGE: It's ok. He's cool.
JAX: What the?
SONYA: Jax!
JOHNNY CAGE: Seriously. He's cool.
JAX: That's amazing!
JOHNNY CAGE: Told ya! Turns out he's a god!
SONYA: Thank you... Raiden.
RAIDEN: Gratitude is unnecessary. I have foreseen events, like memories of my future. They lead me to believe that you are all connected to Earthrealm's fate.
LIU KANG: What have you foreseen?
RAIDEN: In my visions, Shao Kahn becomes invincible. He destroys all life in Earthrealm. We will all die. I believe these flashes are a guide to defeating Shao Kahn. But disrupting the flow of time can have serious consequences.
JOHNNY CAGE: I'm not worried. I bet you could win this thing no problem.
RAIDEN: Unless directly challenged, I cannot participate.
JOHNNY CAGE: What should we do besides standing around looking pretty?
RAIDEN: For now, the tournament must run its course.
SONYA: All right then. We're with you, Raiden.
SHANG TSUNG: Kombatants! The next match will now begin!
SHANG TSUNG: Scorpion! Specter of the Netherrealm! Resurrected by the sorcerer Quan Chi! Who among you is worthy of this challenge?
SCORPION: Where is the Lin Kuei Sub-Zero? He killed my family and clan. I will have his head!
RAIDEN: I know it is you, Kung Lao. The Shaolin monks chose Liu Kang to represent your order in this tournament.
KUNG LAO: I am Liu Kang's equal!
RAIDEN: That remains to be seen.
KUNG LAO: Watch and see.
KUNG LAO: I accept the challenge!
LIU KANG: Kung Lao?
KUNG LAO: Nevermind the Lin Kuei. Now you face a Shaolin.
SCORPION: You will regret your impulsiveness.
SCORPION: You are not yet a warrior.
LIU KANG: Kung Lao!
RAIDEN: Listen when your elders speak! You could not win this fight.
SCORPION: I have defeated the challenger, Shang Tsung. I demand Sub-Zero!
SHANG TSUNG: You will demand nothing! Nightwolf!
NIGHTWOLF: Your aggression is misplaced.
SCORPION: What do you know of my pa--
NIGHTWOLF: You are not the only one whose people have been victimised. But I have found new purpose in serving the Spirits. I do not cling to the past.
SCORPION: You no longer seek retribution? You dishonour your kind. I will honour the memory of my fallen.
SCORPION: The spirits have forsaken you, Shaman.
SHANG TSUNG: An impressive start!
SCORPION: You waste my time, sorcerer!
QUAN CHI: Restraint, Scorpion.
SHANG TSUNG: You will fight Sub-Zero soon enough.
RAIDEN: Scorpion, I understand your desire for revenge. But Nightwolf is right. There are other ways in which you may find peace.
SCORPION: Sub-Zero deserves death.
RAIDEN: Defeat Sub-Zero if you must, but do not kill him. I fear his death will give rise to a more treacherous foe.
SCORPION: I will have my revenge!
RAIDEN: Spare Sub-Zero's life and I will request that the Elder Gods return the Shirai Ryu to the realm of mortals.
CYRAX: I understand there are benefits to the Grand Master's plan, but his plan goes against Lin Kuei principles.
SEKTOR: We are Lin Kuei, Cyrax. We will obey the Grand Master's commands.
CYRAX: It means giving up our free will... our souls. It will turn us into--
SEKTOR: Scorpion.
CYRAX: Your inferior clan is dead. Soon you will join them.
SCORPION: My clan may walk the Earth once more.
SHANG TSUNG: A challenge! Scorpion versus Cyrax and Sektor!
CYRAX: Your obesssion with Sub-Zero ends here.
SCORPION: I will have my revenge, but I will not kill Sub-Zero.
SUB-ZERO: Will not? Or cannot?
SCORPION: You! 
SCORPION: The Shirai Ryu are dead. You will suffer as they did.
SUB-ZERO: To hell with your clan!
SCORPION: No, to Hell with YOU!
SUB-ZERO: The Netherrealm.
SCORPION: This is where I was reborn. This is where you will pay!
SCORPION: I have avenged my family and clan.
QUAN CHI: This is your retribution? Scorpion, kill him.
SCORPION: I... I will not. He has been beaten.
QUAN CHI: Have you forgotten?
SCORPION: What is this?
SCORPION: No...
QUAN CHI: Your clan. Your family.
SCORPION: NO!
SUB-ZERO: That is not me!
JOHNNY CAGE: Ouch.
RAIDEN: Despite my efforts, my vision has come to pass. An unfortunate end. He once defended Earthrealm from the Netherrealm armies of Shinnok and Quan Chi.
CYRAX: Scorpion will pay for this!
RAIDEN: Sub-Zero's fate is his own doing.
CYRAX: His own doing?!
RAIDEN: The Lin Kuei have a history of making ruinous choices.
RAIDEN: Such as the Cyber Initiative.
CYRAX: I am among those speaking out against the Grand Master's plan. Surgically transform the Lin Kuei into glorified robots? It kills our intuition, our instincts.
RAIDEN: Did you speak out against the Lin Kuei's participation in this tournament?
CYRAX: We were invited by Shang Tsung.
RAIDEN: He pays you to kill Earthrealm warriors. Betraying your own realm? I expect better, even from an assassin.
CYRAX: My loyalty is to the Grand Master.
RAIDEN: Victory for Shang Tsung means the end of Earthrealm. And the Lin Kuei.
CYRAX: What are you doing? I'm not here to fight you. I'm assigned to kill Johnny Cage.
SHEEVA: Shang Tsung no longer has need of you.
CYRAX: What do you mean?
SHEEVA: He is terminating your agreement. And you!
CYRAX: I need to have a talk with your master.
BARAKA: This fight is not over.
CYRAX: You mean to finish me? You couldn't even stop the actor!
CYRAX: Now this fight is over. Shang Tsung has turned on me. I need to find out why.
CYRAX: Sektor, we need to talk. Our host tried to have me killed.
SHANG TSUNG: You were speaking with the Thunder God. Your indescretion has jepordised my plan.
SEKTOR: Cyrax is Lin Kuei. He will complete his task.
SHANG TSUNG: We shall see. The next match will be Cyrax versus Johnny Cage.
JOHNNY CAGE: What, me? All right then.
JOHNNY CAGE: Not everyone gets to rumble with a celebrity. Ready for your beatdown, Sunshine? Here it comes!
CYRAX: That should shut you up.
SHANG TSUNG: Finish him!
CYRAX: I won't kill him!
SEKTOR: You were commanded to kill Johnny Cage. You disobeyed.
CYRAX: I eliminated him from the tournament. He didn't need to die.
SEKTOR: You have broken your oath.
CYRAX: I used my judgment!
SEKTOR: The Cyber Initiative will eliminate insubordination.
CYRAX: We're not machines, Sektor. I chose to serve the Lin Kuei. But I will not surrender my free will!
CYRAX: Tell the Grand Master I am finished.
SEKTOR: No one leaves the Lin Kuei--
SHANG TSUNG: Kombatants! I present this latest creation of Shao Kahn. He is many warriors, their souls fused into one being. Behold... Ermac!
RAIDEN: Be wary, Liu Kang. He is unlike anything you have fought before.
SHANG TSUNG: Liu Kang! You are the sole Earthrealm warrior to progress to this final stage of the tournament!
LIU KANG: I am ready.
ERMAC: We are many. You are one. We will destroy you.
LIU KANG: Earthrealm will not fall into your master's hands.
KITANA: He is a greater threat than anticipated. I will insure he does not reach the final challenge.
RAIDEN: Remember Bo' Rai Cho's teachings. For my vision to be realised, you must not let emotion overpower you.
LIU KANG: Your visions. What causes them?
RAIDEN: My future self sent them to me. Perhaps to ensure some outcome.
LIU KANG: Or to prevent one.
FUTURE RAIDEN: He must win!
RAIDEN: "He must win". Those are my last words before I die. I believe it is you who must win.
RAIDEN: This amulet was forged by the Elder Gods. It cracked here in the present after my first vision. If we choose wisely, the future will be secured and the cracks healed.
LIU KANG: I trust you will make the right decisions.
RAIDEN: We must trust in the Elder Gods, Liu Kang.
LIU KANG: You're good! Show me more.
KITANA: Do not underestimate me, Shaolin.
LIU KANG: I am impressed.
KITANA: Do it.
LIU KANG: Do what?
KITANA: Kill me.
LIU KANG: Why would I do that?
KITANA: I came to kill you. I have failed my father. My emperor.
LIU KANG: Shao Kahn is your father?!
KITANA: I have disgraced him. You must kill me.
LIU KANG: I will not.
LIU KANG: This encounter never took place. You have disgraced no one.
LIU KANG: I hope we meet again. Under... different circumstances.
SHANG TSUNG: Kombatants! Only one Earthrealm warrior remains.
SHANG TSUNG: The Shaolin Liu Kang. Is he ready to bear such a heavy burden? Earthrealm's fate is in his hands. Your opponent will be... Scorpion!
LIU KANG: I do not fear you, demon.
SHANG TSUNG: Fighting with Scorpion... the sorcerer Quan Chi!
SCORPION: You have already lost.
LIU KANG: As I said, I do not fear you. I pity you.
RAIDEN: You have done well. But the tournament is not yet over.
LIU KANG: Goro.
JOHNNY CAGE: What's a "Goro"?
SHANG TSUNG: Liu Kang... it has been years since an Earthrealm warrior has progressed this far. But the reigning champion is far beyond your ability. To the Lair with you!
GORO: I did not expect to fight in this tournament.
GORO: But eventually even the Shaolin produce a warrior worthy of a Shokan.
LIU KANG: I know who you are! I am ready for you!
GORO: I will give you a warriors death.
LIU KANG: It seems the Shaolin trained a warrior greater than a Shokan. 
LIU KANG: Shang Tsung! Only one fight remains! Face me... in Mortal Kombat!
SHANG TSUNG: So be it.
LIU KANG: Say it.
SHANG TSUNG: I concede.
KUNG LAO: Well done, my friend.
RAIDEN: He has saved Earthrealm.
SONYA: That was awesome, Liu Kang!
NIGHTWOLF: Congratulations.
JAX: Way to go, kid!
JOHNNY CAGE: MVP, baby!
SHAO KAHN: You failed me! Five hundred years I have waited! Now I must wait five hundred more!
SHANG TSUNG: My lord! All is not lost!
SHAO KAHN: Curse the Elder Gods and their tournament!
SHANG TSUNG: My lord!
SHAO KAHN: I should have taken Earthrealm by force! But I am bound by their rules.
SHAO KAHN: Rules that cannot be broken.
SHANG TSUNG: My lord--
SHAO KAHN: Kill him!
SHANG TSUNG: But what if the rules were changed?
SHAO KAHN: Kitana!
SHAO KAHN: Continue...
RAIDEN: I do not understand why my amulet is furthur damaged. "He must win". If not Liu Kang, then who?
JAX: Ya got me. Not sure anybody coulda done what he did. Made Shang Tsung look like a chump.
RAIDEN: Here to congratulate us on our victory, sorcerer?
JAX: What? Shang Tsung?!
RAIDEN: You have been revitalised, I see. I didn't realise your master was in the habit of rewarding failure.
SHANG TSUNG: The emperor has an offer, Raiden. A new tournament.
RAIDEN: Heh. I see no reason to participate in any plan of yours.
SHANG TSUNG: The emperor proposes a single tournament, to replace the current system of ten. It will be held in Outworld. If Earthrealm does not win, Outworld will absorb it. But if Earthrealm wins, Shao Kahn will abandon his claim to it forever.
RAIDEN: Give your emperor my regards.
RAIDEN: He gained a momentary advantage during our kombat and escaped. I now realise what we must do.
JAX: Uggh... Anybody get the number o' that--? Wait. Where's Sonya?
RAIDEN: Shang Tsung has taken her.
JAX: We've gotta find her!
KUNG LAO: We must follow them!
RAIDEN: Shang Tsung has made it clear that Earthrealm will be under constant threat unless I agree to a new tournament. 
JAX: Another vision?
RAIDEN: Yes. I saw Liu Kang win the proposed tournament. I believe we must attend. But my earlier vision, of your victory over Shang Tsung, was not the solution I sought. Therefore this premonition must show an event I need to change. Perhaps "He must win" refers to another.
RAIDEN: Hear me, Elder Gods! I accept the terms proposed by Shao Kahn!
RAIDEN: We go to Outworld.
JAX: I assume that's the Big Man himself.
JOHNNY CAGE: The wrestler guy with the cow skull on his head? And why aren't the Kung Fu Twins here helping us?
RAIDEN: I sent Liu Kang and Kung Lao to free their Shaolin masters. I expected Sonya Blade to be here with Shang Tsung.
JAX: She'd better not have a scratch on her.
RAIDEN: Wait! This is a tournament!
SHANG TSUNG: Ah! the Earthrealm delegation has arrived. And we have a volunteer for First Kombat!
JAX: What?
SHAO KAHN: The tournament will begin!
SHANG TSUNG: Jackson Briggs! You will face... Baraka!
JAX: Damn, you ugly.
BARAKA: My blades will find your heart!
JAX: You shouldn't be runnin' with those.
JAX: Where's Sonya?
SHANG TSUNG: Tell me, Major Briggs; Do you and she do anything other than rescue one another?
SHANG TSUNG: Your next opponent will be--
SHANG TSUNG: What is it?
SHANG TSUNG: Excellent. It seems I have a pressing matter to attend to. With the emperor's permission, we will reconvene later.
JAX: What was that all about? I think we should follow 'im.
JAX: You ok?
RAIDEN: Sonya Blade... she is to be executed. My powers are compromised here in Outworld, but I will be able to transport us near enough to her.
JOHNNY CAGE: Maybe you could try for even nearer next time? Where are we?
RAIDEN: I will inform you the instant I know.
JAX: Wish this damn tracking device worked in here.
JOHNNY CAGE: This is just like my movie "Time Smashers". We were goin' around in ti--
JAX: Give it a rest, will ya? Makin' my ears hurt.
JOHNNY CAGE: So what's the deal with you and Sonya, anyway? She's smokin' hot!
JAX: It's not like that. I'm her C.O.
JOHNNY CAGE: Honey like that, under my command? Oh I'd be so--
JAX: You'll wanna stop talking now.
JOHNNY CAGE: ...But if it's not like that, then you won't mind if I--
JAX: That's it! Time somebody shut you the hell up!
JAX: How you like that, Mr. A-List?
RAIDEN: Enough! Jackson Briggs, you will restrain yourself.
JAX: Yeah well, I--
RAIDEN: Someone approaches.
JAX: Good. Maybe somebody else needs their ass whooped.
JAX: You lookin' for somethin'?
JADE: The Armoury is restricted. You will leave now.
JAX: Gonna have to ask nicer than that.
JAX: Wrong place, wrong time, lady.
JOHNNY CAGE: Feel better?
JAX: Uh, listen, Cage, I--
JOHNNY CAGE: Don't worry about it. Guess we know where we are now, thanks to her.
RAIDEN: Yes. And where we must go.
JAX: Let's do it.
JOHNNY CAGE: Uh, um--
JAX: C'mon, Cage.
SONYA: What is it with you Shokan and underground cesspools?
SHEEVA: If you had not dishonoured yourself by attempting escape, we would not be here in this sewer.
JOHNNY CAGE: Sonya!
SHEEVA: Guards! Stop them!
JAX: So much for the surprise attack...
SHEEVA: She is the emperor's property, human.
JAX: She's nobody's property.
JAX: I guess extra arms don't make a difference.
SONYA: You sure have a way with women.
JAX: You know me. I'm a class act.
SONYA: Thanks. What took you so long?
JOHNNY CAGE: He was busy hitting me in the face. Jax and Sonya exchange smiles at this. Something then perks up on her wrist communicator.
SONYA: That's weird. I've got two sets of readings, heavy tech signals, both of 'em.
RAIDEN: Technology... Then they cannot be of Outworld. We need to confront the source of each signal. We might discover the one whose victory I must insure.
JOHNNY CAGE: Wait. What about us? What are we? Chopped liver?
JOHNNY CAGE: What?
RAIDEN: Perhaps you are right, Johnny Cage. You will stay close to me.
JOHNNY CAGE: Great, I--
RAIDEN: Close as a shadow, and twice as silent.
JAX: Sonya, you're with me. Keepin' my eye on you. Raiden, looks like you'll wanna teleport yourself about thirty klicks that way.
SMOKE: We should stay together, Tundra. Assuming your brother's identity will certainly draw attention. Not all of it welcome.
SUB-ZERO: You are right, Smoke. But assuming Bi-Han's identity is the best way to honour him.
SMOKE: Let us proceed then, Sub-Zero.
SUB-ZERO: We should separate. Our fellow Lin Kuei will not be far behind once our absence is discovered.
SMOKE: If only they had been more forthcoming with the details of your brother's demise. We will find Shang Tsung. He will tell us all he knows.
SUB-ZERO: If he killed Bi-Han, he will die.
SUB-ZERO: Be stealthful as the night...
SMOKE: ...and deadly as the dawn.
KITANA: The emperor was wise to send me here. The Lin Kuei do walk uninvitied in his realm.
SMOKE: Wise though your emperor might be, he was foolish to send his housemaid to interfere with Lin Kuei business.
KITANA: I am Kitana, Princess of Outworld! And I deal harshly with sharp-tongued intruders!
SMOKE: Where there is Smoke, there is fire.
SMOKE: Sleep well, princess.
KANO: With a whole army totin' these, no one in Outworld or Earthrealm could stand up to you.
SHANG TSUNG: Well done. You may tell your fellow Black Dragon that I am very interested in your merchandise.
SMOKE: Shang Tsung!
KANO: I'll take care of him. No charge.
KANO: One dead Lin Kuei in a tick.
SMOKE: Stay down. I would have words with your associate.
SMOKE: Tell me what you know of Sub-Zero's death.
SMOKE: What?
SHANG TSUNG: Despite his failure at my tournament, I'll wager he was more powerful than you, Lin Kuei.
SMOKE: Assuming his form will not give you his skill, shapeshifter.
SHANG TSUNG: Let us see if smoke can freeze.
SMOKE: Now answer me! What do you know of Sub-Zero?
SMOKE: What?
SEKTOR: Smoke!
SEKTOR: You have disobeyed the directive to remain at the Lin Kuei temple.
SMOKE: Sektor?!
SEKTOR: You will return with us to begin your transformation.
SMOKE: You actually did it... You're a cyborg!
SEKTOR: We are the Lin Kuei. More stealthful than the night... more deadly than the dawn!
SMOKE: I will never submit!
RAIDEN: There is great energy nearby.
JOHNNY CAGE: Um... Rai-dude...
RAIDEN: They must not take him.
SMOKE: Thank you, Lord Raiden. I am called Smoke.
SMOKE: Why are you here in Outworld?
RAIDEN: To participate in a tournament to save Earthrealm. Join us, Smoke.
SMOKE: Forgive me, but if Sektor was searching for me, he is hunting Sub-Zero as well.
JOHNNY CAGE: Sub-Zero? Call me crazy with a K... but didn't we see him die?
SMOKE: The Grand Master intends to turn every Lin Kuei into a cyborg. My friend is in danger.
RAIDEN: The tournament. I have a feeling your friend will be there.
SMOKE: Then let us go. Sub-Zero's soul depends on it.
SUB-ZERO: A pity you could not have cooperated.
CYRAX: You are ordered to return to the Lin Kuei temple for assimilation.
SUB-ZERO: Cyrax!
CYRAX: I am Lin Kuei Unit L-K-4-D-4. You will come with me.
SUB-ZERO: I am sorry for what they did to you, but I will not comply.
SUB-ZERO: I will face the Lin Kuei when my task is done, not before.
SONYA: The readings were getting stronger and now they're gone. I--
SONYA: Sub-Zero?! But... you're dead!
SUB-ZERO: I am not the Sub-Zero you speak of. He was my brother.
SONYA: Your... brother?
SUB-ZERO: I'm only here to learn Sub-Zero's fate.
SONYA: He was killed by someone named Scorpion.
SUB-ZERO: Where would I find him?
SONYA: Try the Coliseum. That's where--
ERMAC: You have disturbed our regeneration process.
JAX: Ermac!
JAX: Gotcha!
SONYA: Jax!
SONYA: Stay with me, Jax!
ERMAC: We will break you as well.
SUB-ZERO: Not if I break you first.
SUB-ZERO: I remain whole, for now.
SONYA: Sonya Blade to Command. Sonya Blade to Command. Do you read? Sonya Blade to Command. Do you read?
SUB-ZERO: You have stopped the bleeding.
SONYA: Yeah, but he needs a medic as soon as possible.
SUB-ZERO: I must go to the Coliseum.
SONYA: But I need your help to get him t--
SUB-ZERO: There is a portal to the south. You can use it to transport yourselves back to Earthrealm.
SONYA: Motherf... That portal better be close...
MONK: I have failed. I deserve death.
KITANA: I have failed my father. You must kill me.
SHAO KAHN: Kill him!
SHAO KAHN: Kitana! You will join me.
SUB-ZERO: Shao Kahn! I challenge Scorpion, the murderer of my brother! You will bring him before me!
SHANG TSUNG: No one makes demands of the emperor! Reptile!
SUB-ZERO: I would kill you, but that is not my purpose here.
SUB-ZERO: Your followers hold you in high esteem, warlord. They fight and die for your amusement. My brother participated in this folly. I do so only to face his killer!
SHAO KAHN: And you shall.
SCORPION: What is this? You are not Sub-Zero.
SUB-ZERO: I am his family and clan. I fight for his honour.
SCORPION: He had no honour! And you will die as he did!
SUB-ZERO: For my brother!
SUB-ZERO: No! You--
SHANG TSUNG: Who now interrupts the emperor's tournament?
SMOKE: Sub-Zero?! No!
RAIDEN: You cannot save him! Stay here or they will take you as well.
SEKTOR: We request that we may return him to our temple for judgment.
SHAO KAHN: And what do I gain from granting this bold request?
CYRAX: The Lin Kuei's loyalty and service.
SHAO KAHN: Very well. He is yours.
RAIDEN: The flow of time has been changed. I spared Smoke this fate, only to watch this new Sub-Zero fall.
SUB-ZERO: No! I will not be turned!
SHAO KAHN: Kitana! 
SHAO KAHN: How is it that Earthrealm ninjas brazenly appear before me when my daughter, Princess of Outworld, was sent to intercept them?
KITANA: Father, I--
SHAO KAHN: Begone!
SHAO KAHN: Continue.
RAIDEN: Kitana's faith is a slender reed, bent before the storm. If it can be uprooted altogether...
JOHNNY CAGE: Sure. Let's go ruin someone else's life.
KITANA: Is this how you show your loyalty, Jade?
JADE: Kitana, I--
KITANA: You follow me when I clearly wish to be alone, then you upbraid me? I will not be scolded like some child!
JADE: You need to be careful. I have never seen your father this angry with you.
JADE: You are a princess. He expects more from you than this.
KITANA: I know what he expects!
JADE: We will talk later. When you are in more of a mind to listen.
RAIDEN: Princess Kitana. I request an audience.
KITANA: Earthrealmers! You dare approach me?
JOHNNY CAGE: Hey listen, honey, we don't wanna fight.
SMOKE: But we will if we must!
KITANA: You will learn respect!
KITANA: Shao Kahn wants death to follow kombat. I will give it to him.
RAIDEN: Perhaps Liu Kang was wrong about you. Or perhaps he sensed, as I do, that there is conflict within you.
JOHNNY CAGE: Thanks. Ow. You couldn't've seen that in one o' your hot flashes?
RAIDEN: Something whispers to you that circumstances should be different. That you should be different. You are much more like Sindel than Shao Ka--
RAIDEN: But... she is dead...
KITANA: My mother is dead, yes. Why do you--
RAIDEN: You need answers, Kitana. I can help you find them, if you will trust in me. Go to Shang Tsung's Flesh Pits. Much will be revealed there.
KITANA: The Flesh Pits? But I am forbidden to--
RAIDEN: Yes. You are. And why is that?
KITANA: I... don't know. Tell me--
RAIDEN: You must discover your true path. Alone.
KITANA: Show yourself, Jade. I know you're following me. Again.
JADE: Following you still. I know where you're going. I am ordered to prevent you from going there.
KITANA: And why is that?
JADE: I do not question the emperor's commands. Kitana, please. Turn back.
KITANA: I cannot. This path might lead me to the truth. I'm sorry, Jade... but I will not allow you to stop me.
KITANA: I tried to warn you... This is something I have to do.
KITANA: What in the name of... 
KITANA: She looks like... me!
MILEENA: Sister!
MILEENA: So pretty, so fair, so sad and alone... Come. Let us be a family!
KITANA: You are not my family. You are a monstrosity!
KITANA: Farewell, sister!
SHANG TSUNG: That is no way to treat your sibling.
KITANA: Despicable swine! Do you think my father will stand for this... these... abominations you have created here?!
SHANG TSUNG: I am merely perfecting you, princess. As difficult as that might be.
KITANA: Silence! I will drag you before Shao Kahn by your pointed beard!
KITANA: Get up.
KITANA: You will stand before my father and confess your deeds.
KITANA: I would not disturb you, father, if this matter were not of upmost importance. I felt you should know what Shang Tsung has been doing as of late. This conjurer has created horrid replicas of me-- crossbred with Tarkatan blood! One was alive-- and attacked me!
SHAO KAHN: Well done, sorcerer.
KITANA: You know... You... approve? How could you? My own father!
SHAO KAHN: I am your emperor! Your father was a weaking Edenian king. I annihilated him while merging his realm with Outworld and took his queen as my wife. If only I had not allowed Sindel to convince me of your worth... But now I have a true daughter!
KITANA: Raiden was right. You have lied to me my entire life.
SHAO KAHN: Escort her to the Tower. I will make an example of her.
SHAO KAHN: Return to the Flesh Pits. Bring me my daughter. Mileena.
JADE: I failed you, Kitana. Now I will make amends.
BARAKA: That is all of them.
BARAKA: That is no toy! It belongs to Shang Tsung! We are finished. Return to your post.
JADE: Stand aside. I will see Kitana.
BARAKA: No one enters the Tower.
JADE: You are an excellent guard dog, Baraka. But you must learn to heel.
BARAKA: I do not take orders from you.
JADE: Good boy.
BARAKA: Edenians have no loyalty.
JADE: Blind loyalty is not a good thing, as I have learned. You must keep your eyes open-- to anticipate the finishing blow.
BARAKA: What are you talki--
JADE: You make it too easy. 
SHEEVA: If you had not dishonoured yourself by--
KITANA: Jade!
SHEEVA: My orders are clear. No one is allowed in the Tower.
JADE: As you can see, I am here.
SHEEVA: Here to help the princess escape! You would deny her execution? The only means of regaining her honour?
JADE: We have very different concepts of honour, Shokan.
JADE: Not much of a jailor, are you?
JADE: Now then, Your Highness, let us see how quickly we can remove these bonds.
KITANA: Jade, I...
JADE: I am too.
BARAKA: Stop her!
MILEENA: Do not let her get away!
KITANA: Go. Find Raiden. Ask for his help.
JADE: That should distance me from any pursuers.
MILEENA: Others pursue. I find.
JADE: By the gods... You are Mileena!
MILEENA: You must return with me! There is to be a celebration for my sister! She is going away...
JADE: I am more of a sister to Kitana than you. I must find Raiden.
RAIDEN: He is here.
SMOKE: Kitana turns away from Shao Kahn so you attack her rather than join her?
JADE: This is not--
RAIDEN: Smoke, stop! That is not Kitana!
SMOKE: You will come no closer!
JADE: I did not wish to do that.
JADE: Lord Raiden. I come at the request of--
JOHNNY CAGE: "Lord"? I was with Smoke. I thought she was a bad guy-- eh, girl. Guess he turned another one. What's Raiden got that I haven't got?
LIU KANG: God-like power?
KUNG LAO: A personality that is not at all like sanding paper?
JOHNNY CAGE: Jerks.
JADE: ...if we do not save her, she will be executed. Kitana does not have much time!
LIU KANG: Kitana... executed? Where is she?
JADE: Held captive in the Tower of Shao Kahn's fortress.
LIU KANG: I wil--
RAIDEN: I am not pleased with this outcome either, Liu Kang. But there is no time. We must return to the tournament.
LIU KANG: But you are responsible for her capture! You persuaded her to turn against Shao Kahn!
KUNG LAO: Lord Raiden, we can free her as others fight in our stead, and join you thereafter.
RAIDEN: Very well.
KUNG LAO: We will meet you at the Coliseum.
KUNG LAO: I hope your girlfriend is worth Lord Raiden's anger, Liu Kang.
LIU KANG: Notice that I am ignoring you.
KUNG LAO: Hmm... They must have relocated Kitana.
NOOB: We have indeed. We knew someone would come for her.
NOOB: May you join her in death!
KUNG LAO: Be thankful I choose not to spill your tainted blood.
KUNG LAO: Who are you? There is something familiar...
KUNG LAO: Do you need help? Four arms against two is hardly a fair fight.
GORO: Liu Kang?!
KUNG LAO: You have had your match against Liu Kang. Now you will face me!
KUNG LAO: Now, if you have any honour left... you will tell us where Kitana is!
GORO: She has been taken to the Coliseum, where she has no doubt been executed.
LIU KANG: You lie!
KUNG LAO: She may let live. Let us go.
SHANG TSUNG: Ermac wins!
KUNG LAO: There's Kitana.
LIU KANG: I must free her!
RAIDEN: Not now! Smoke and Johnny Cage have been defeated, and I no longer sense Jackson Briggs' or Sonya Blade's presence in Outworld. Despite my doubts as to whether you are Earthrealm's saviour, you must fight!
LIU KANG: But I am not "He Who Must Win".
SHAO KAHN: Raiden! Put forth a worthy champion... if you can.
RAIDEN: Perhaps you are meant to be the victor.
SHAO KAHN: You will face Shang Tsung.
SHAO KAHN: And Quan Chi.
QUAN CHI: No Earthrealm boy can stop this Deadly Alliance.
SHANG TSUNG: On that we agree.
KUNG LAO: It is done!
SHANG TSUNG: No, Kung Lao. Not nearly so.
KINTARO: I will eat your heart!
KUNG LAO: You see, Raiden? Earthrealm is fre--
RAIDEN: Kung Lao!
LIU KANG: NO!!
RAIDEN: I will strip the flesh from your bones!
SHAO KAHN: Witless boy. Do you know who I am?
LIU KANG: The murderer of my friend!
SHAO KAHN: I am Shao Kahn! Konquerer of Worlds! You will taste no victory.
LIU KANG: You will taste your own blood!
LIU KANG: On your feet!
LIU KANG: For Kung Lao, the Shaolin and Earthrealm!
SHANG TSUNG: I cannot believe... Earthrealm has won.
RAIDEN: The Elder Gods have spoken. Earthrealm is free of Shao Kahn forever.
RAIDEN: But the price of victory was almost too steep to pay. Kung Lao's death is my fault. I encouraged him. Our triumph was not meant to be achieved in this way. I see now. "He must win" refers to you. But to prevent Armageddon, you needed to defeat Shao Kahn, not Shang Tsung.
RAIDEN: It cannot be! Shao Kahn is dead! Yet the future remains unchanged!
GORO: Shao Kahn is finished.
BARAKA: Mileena is his heir. She should rule.
SHANG TSUNG: Mileena? She exists only because of my sorcery.
SHAO KAHN: And you breathe because I restrain mine.
SHANG TSUNG: Emperor!
MOTARO: You live!
SHAO KAHN: I am not so easily killed. Quan Chi accelerated my recovery.
SHANG TSUNG: Emperor, I--
SHAO KAHN: Not. One. Word. Because of you, Outworld can no longer merge with Earthrealm!
QUAN CHI: There may yet be an alternative, Emperor. Invasion.
SHANG TSUNG: Uh-- Invasion?!
SHAO KAHN: Do you mock me? Sindel's Ward prevents me from setting foot in Earthrealm.
QUAN CHI: Have you considered why your wife and empress chose to betray you in this particular fashion?
SHAO KAHN: Of course. But even after millenia, her motives are a mystery.
QUAN CHI: She realised that the safeguards afforded by the Elder Gods through Mortal Kombat are but fiction. She sacrificed herself to give Earthrealm protection the Elder Gods could not. So Earthrealm could not suffer as had Edenia.
SHAO KAHN: Indeed.
QUAN CHI: I have mastered the spells necessary for her resurrection. Her ward will be nullified. And with it the barrier that prevents your entry into Earthrealm.
QUAN CHI: I will return her to you, of course. 
QUAN CHI: You will find her much more... cooperative.
SHAO KAHN: This is a very magnanimous offer.
QUAN CHI: I wish only to serve, Emperor.
SHAO KAHN: I am weary of sorcerers, Quan Chi. Prove your worth. Bring her to me.
QUAN CHI: Sindel.
SINDEL: Quan Chi?
QUAN CHI: Shao Kahn looks forward to your return.
SINDEL: The emperor! Yesss.
SINDEL: What of Kitana?
QUAN CHI: Kitana now allies herself with Earthrealm.
SINDEL: Then she is no longer my daughter. Take me to Shao Kahn.
QUAN CHI: Yes, Empress.
QUAN CHI: The invasion of Earthrealm can now begin.
STRYKER: Fifteen... Sixteen... Seventeen... Eighteen. Kabal, call it in.
KABAL: Base. Eagle Two. We count eighteen. One-eight bogies. Southbound on Olympic.
BASE: Roger that.
KABAL: Eagle Two out.
STRYKER: This is not happening.
KABAL: Not what I was thinking when I swore to protect and serve.
STRYKER: What is that?
KABAL: I'm thinking shoot first, ask questions later.
STRYKER: Fine with me.
STRYKER: Pistols!
STRYKER: Enough of this! It's you and me, Freakshow!
STRYKER: Spitting? Sticking out your tongue? Bet your mama's real proud.
STRYKER: C'mon. We're going street level. We've been compromised.
KABAL: It ain't safe down there.
STRYKER: Better there than here.
KABAL: Stryker! Check her out!
KABAL: Whaddya think? Friend or foe.
STRYKER: Foe.
KABAL: Dressed like that?
STRYKER: Definitely foe. Cover me.
STRYKER: Hey, what're you doing out here?
MILEENA: Looking for a new playmate!
STRYKER: You're coming with me.
STRYKER: Who... who are you?
STRYKER: You all right?
STRYKER: Johnny Cage fighting a giant monster? What is this, "Time Smashers"?!
KABAL: That guy just shot lightning. From his hands. How'd he do that?
STRYKER: No idea.
STRYKER: Spread out. Give 'im multiple targets.
KINTARO: Humans. Less ugly when they burn.
STRYKER: Never knew I had it in me...
STRYKER: Kabal!
STRYKER: Base! Eagle Two! 
BASE: Go Eagle Two.
STRYKER: Need Medevac. Current position. Kabal is down. Third-degree burns.
BASE: Medevac unit routing to you. ETA ten minutes.
STRYKER: What the?!
BASE: Say again?
STRYKER: Eeeeugh!
BASE: Eagle Two, report! Eagle Two!
ERMAC: The emperor will have your soul.
STRYKER: Yeah? Come and get it!
STRYKER: I think I'll be keeping my soul.
NIGHTWOLF: I have been searching for you, Kurtis Stryker.
STRYKER: Well you found me! Who are you?
NIGHTWOLF: I am Nightwolf. Lord Raiden is gathering Earth's defenders. You are among them.
STRYKER: What the hell are you talking about?!
NIGHTWOLF: Raiden leads Earth's defense against these Outworld invaders. He is our best hope for survival.
STRYKER: Yeah, well. "Earthrealm Defender" is about ten steps above my pay grade.
NIGHTWOLF: I see you doubt yourself, even after your victories. Come.
STRYKER: What?
STRYKER: Where is he? Medevac hasn't been here.
NIGHTWOLF: Perhaps he has gone to find help.
STRYKER: Naw, he was way too banged up. Someone took him.
KANO: Easy there, mate. You've had a rough one.
KABAL: Kano?
KANO: Heh heh, in the flesh.
KABAL: I was... on fire...
KANO: Burned to a crisp, you were. Good thing I found ya.
KABAL: I'm hideous...
KANO: Shang Tsung's magic healed the rest of ya. But your lungs? Yeesh.
KABAL: Take it off.
KANO: Can't. It's permanent.
KABAL: What?
KANO: No mask, no breathing.
KABAL: I'm... a freak!
KANO: Go on. Give 'em a whirl.
KABAL: I don't use those anymore.
KANO: Yeah, you're all proper police now. The Black Dragon ain't the same without ya, mate. You should come back. We're in the money on this war.
KABAL: You sold those monsters their firepower.
KANO: Guilty as charged.
KABAL: This is YOUR fault!
KANO: What're you on about, eh? 
KANO: You're here, ain't ya?
KABAL: I should be dead! Now you're gonna be!
KABAL: Now how do I get outta here?
KANO: Not so keen on being dead now, are ya?
KABAL: How do I get outta here?
KANO: Heh, good luck. No one gets outta Outworld with Shao Kahn's say-so.
KABAL: Outworld? Shao Kahn?
KANO: Shao Kahn's the big boss round here, and soon, Earth's new master.
KABAL: Where is he?
KANO: Don't bother. You can't get near him.
KABAL: No. But I'm guessing you can.
SHAO KAHN: What is this?
MILEENA: Raiden has killed Motaro.
KABAL: That's him? On the throne?
KANO: You're a right genius, you are.
SINDEL: It's no great matter. I will go to Earthrealm. To finish Motaro's work.
SHAO KAHN: Yes. Shang Tsung.
SHANG TSUNG: Yes, Emperor?
SHAO KAHN: The empress requires something of you.
KANO: See there? I'm thinking he's a bit much--
KABAL: I can take him.
MILEENA: No one attacks the emperor!
KABAL: And I thought I was a freak.
SHAO KAHN: Quan Chi! Seal the portal!
KABAL: Time to go.
KABAL: Huh?
KABAL: This speed's incredible! Guess it's a side-effect of the Outworld magic.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: You are not authorised for portal use.
KABAL: Yeah? Says who?
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Sub-Zero. Unit L-K-5-2-0.
KABAL: Heh, you say that like it means something.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: As you will soon discover.
KABAL: Ha! Not as cool as you thought.
SHEEVA: Why do you turn on your brother, Lin Kuei?
KABAL: That is not my brother. He's machine. I'm human.
SHEEVA: You do not appear human.
KABAL: Don't let the mask fool ya.
KABAL: Starting to feel like the old days - only faster.
SMOKE: Sub-Zero!
RAIDEN: You have great power indeed, Kabal.
KABAL: Wait. You're the lightning guy. You helped Stryker. Stryker! Is he--
RAIDEN: He is safe. He has joined us in the fight against Shao Kahn. We would welcome your aid also.
SMOKE: Sub-Zero!
RAIDEN: That which made him Sub-Zero no longer exists.
SMOKE: He is my friend. What they did to him... it is... hideous.
KABAL: You're right. We gotta help him if we can.
JAX: That's it. Here goes nothing...
SMOKE: You are certain this will work?
JAX: Hell no! I've never done this before. It's not like there's a manual.
SMOKE: Sub-Zero? Can he hear me?
JAX: He should.
SMOKE: Sub-Zero?
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Yes, Smoke.
SMOKE: How do you feel?
SMOKE: What is it?
CYBER SUB-ZERO: I remember... The things I have done for Shao Kahn... 
CYBER SUB-ZERO: He cannot be allowed to merge the realms.
NIGHTWOLF: Haokah, how can Sub-Zero best help us?
RAIDEN: I do not know. My attempts to alter future events have had negative consequences. Sub-Zero should never have undergone this transformation. Enlisting him may only further divert the flow of time.
STRYKER: We need intel, right? Let's send him back to Outworld undercover.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: They will be unaware of my defection. I could deceive them.
NOOB: Earthrealm is finished. It will not be missed.
SEKTOR: Very well. You will return.
SEKTOR: You report late. Where is the intruder?
CYBER SUB-ZERO: I killed him in Earthrealm.
SEKTOR: He should have been saved for interrogation.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: He was formidable. I had no choice.
SEKTOR: Follow me. We must lead a new mission.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: What mission brings us here?
SEKTOR: I have scanned your neural net, 5-2-0. Your neuromodulators have been recalibrated.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Impossible.
SEKTOR: The experience has been deleted from your system. Remove your access panel.
SEKTOR: Your programming has been corrupted.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: My soul was corrupted. Now it is cleansed.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Artificial enhancements are no substitute for the human soul.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Thank you, Sektor.
KANO: Oy! Run about, will ya?
KANO: Finally! C'mon, we gotta get 'em to the graveyard at Saint Dominic's. On yer feet, all of ya!
CYBER SUB-ZERO: For what purpose?
KANO: Don't care, really. So long as I get paid.
KINTARO: He said on your feet!
GORO: C'mon, up.
KINTARO: Get up.
KANO: Hey! What're--
CYBER SUB-ZERO: I will help you.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Go! All of you! Now!
SOLDIERS: Let's go! C'mon!
KINTARO: Your treachery will be punished!
CYBER SUB-ZERO: All those teeth and claws, yet still overmatched.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Behind me!
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Come no further, fiend of Outworld!
CYBER SUB-ZERO: You are not so fearsome.
SOLDIER 1: Thanks. I thought we were done.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: I must go. I need to investigate the graveyard.
SOLDIER 2: We'd go with, but we have to return to our unit.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: That is for the best.
SOLDIER 1: Good luck, man.
SOLDIER 2: He ain't gonna need luck.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: This is Sub-Zero. I have encountered Quan Chi. He seems to be casting a spell.
NIGHTWOLF: Raiden, what is it? What did you see?
RAIDEN: One of Shao Kahn's Soulnados, on a scale I thought unimaginable. All of Earthrealm's souls imprisoned, absorbed by Shao Kahn, multiplying his power!
NIGHTWOLF: That is what Sub-Zero has found?
RAIDEN: No matter my efforts, the future remains in peril. How could I have failed Earthrealm?
NIGHTWOLF: Do not lose faith in the spirits, Raiden. They will guide you. Protect you. Sub-Zero, we will disrupt the Soulnado. I will be there momentarily.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Hurry. The spell appears to be nearly complete.
QUAN CHI: Who is that?
NOOB: The one Kano warned about. He is mine.
NOOB: You. You are not worthy of the name Sub-Zero.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Who are you to judge?
NOOB: I wore those colours before you.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Bi-Han?!
NOOB: Yes, Kuai Liang. It is I. Quan Chi restored me.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Restored? You and I both. We are flawed copies of our former selves.
NOOB: I have no flaws. Quan Chi has perfected me.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: For what end? To serve the Netherrealm and Outworld?
NOOB: It suits my purpose.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: But brother, we--
NOOB: We share blood. We are not brothers.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Then I will not regret your defeat.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: You are right. We are not brothers.
NIGHTWOLF: Go! Your soul is not safe!
QUAN CHI: Earthrealm's fate is sealed, Nightwolf!
NIGHTWOLF: Not yet! We fight until the end!
NIGHTWOLF: Your time is over.
NIGHTWOLF: Pilamaya. 
SONYA: But how do we know? Raiden could be having visions of possible futures, not the future.
JAX: Sonya's right. Was I supposed to have my arms replaced with these? Or was it caused by interfering with the timeline?
JOHNNY CAGE: My head hurts just thinking about it.
KITANA: This isn't helpful. We cannot second guess our decisions. Raiden, what are your thoughts?
KITANA: Raiden?
RAIDEN: Yes, that is best.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: What is our next objective?
LIU KANG: Nightwolf!
NIGHTWOLF: It is done. Earthrealm's souls are safe.
RAIDEN: No! How is it not enough?!
RAIDEN: I must speak with the Elder Gods. Shao Kahn's violation must be punished.
LIU KANG: But the battle is joined here, in Earthrealm!
RAIDEN: We cannot win without the Elder Gods.
LIU KANG: But Master--
JOHNNY CAGE: Liu Kang, close as a shadow...
RAIDEN: Nightwolf, you will lead until we return.
NIGHTWOLF: As you wish, Haokah.
STRYKER: Well, now what? Standing around here won't do us any good.
CYBER SUB-ZERO: Wait!
CYBER SUB-ZERO: The Lin Kuei! They surround us!
STRYKER: So much for standing around.
NIGHTWOLF: Attack!
CYRAX: My speed and skill are beyond you.
NIGHTWOLF: Mere speed and skill will not win this war, Cyrax.
SEKTOR: You are weak, Smoke.
SEKTOR: Now do you understand? The power of the Grand Master's vision?
NIGHTWOLF: You are no match for the power of the Spirits.
NIGHTWOLF: Perhaps even you can be saved.
NIGHTWOLF: What is it?
KITANA: Mother...
SINDEL: Come forward, if you dare. I will finish what the Lin Kuei could not.
JAX: Let's do this.
NIGHTWOLF: Attack!
KITANA: Mother, please!
SINDEL: I am no longer your mother.
KITANA: Mother, this is not your way. Shao Kahn has corrupted you!
SINDEL: Shao Kahn has resurrected me! You have betrayed him. Embraced a pathetic cause.
KITANA: Remember Edenia, mother. Remember your rule before Shao Kahn's invasion!
SINDEL: Quiet, child. It is time for you to join your friends.
NIGHTWOLF: Monster!
SINDEL: Still alive? No matter. Soon you will reunite with your ancestors.
NIGHTWOLF: Now, Sindel. Face the Spirit's judgment.
SONYA: Raiden... Raiden, where are you?
RAIDEN: Elder Gods, I beseech you. Earthrealm is in danger.
ELDER GODS: We are aware of your plight, Raiden.
RAIDEN: Then you must intervene on Earthrealm's behalf.
ELDER GODS: We cannot.
RAIDEN: But Shao Kahn... Liu Kang has bested him twice, yet he still--
ELDER GODS: Shao Kahn has not violated the rules of Mortal Kombat.
RAIDEN: What?! He invades Earthrealm as we speak!
ELDER GODS: Invasion is not itself a transgression. It is the merger of realms that is proscribed.
RAIDEN: A distinction without a difference! Innocents are dying at the hands of Outworld!
ELDER GODS: It is regrettable. But the Mortal Kombat tournaments are not intended to prevent certain outcomes. They are intended only to maintain balance among the realms.
RAIDEN: Please, you must--
ELDER GODS: We have spoken.
RAIDEN: The last doors are closing. We are nearly trapped.
SINDEL: Victory is mine, Shaman.
NIGHTWOLF: Not if I... take it - from - you!
LIU KANG: By the Elder Gods!
KITANA: Liu Kang...
LIU KANG: Kitana!
KITANA: Liu Kang... You were right. I wish we had met... under... different... cirumstances.
LIU KANG: Kitana...
LIU KANG: They are dead.
RAIDEN: Liu Kang, I--
LIU KANG: We abandoned them and they're dead.
RAIDEN: My heart, too, is heavy with their sacrifice.
LIU KANG: Their deaths achieved nothing!
LIU KANG: What is next, Raiden? Tell me the future! How do we honor their "sacrifice"?
RAIDEN: I climbed to heaven, now I must plunge into the depths. I will go to Quan Chi. Ally our realm with his against the forces of Outworld.
LIU KANG: What?! Grovel before Quan Chi?! What will he demand? What price will be paid?
RAIDEN: Would any price be too high to save Earthrealm?
LIU KANG: I had prayed it not true. But you have gone mad, Raiden. Your visions. They are nothing. Delusions of an addled mind.
RAIDEN: Liu Kang, please.
LIU KANG: Enough. I must help the wounded. Leave on your hopeless quest.
RAIDEN: May the Elder Gods protect you.
RAIDEN: Quan Chi! Quan Chi!
RAIDEN: It disappoints me to see you here.
SCORPION: Save your pity.
RAIDEN: I will have an audience with Quan Chi.
SCORPION: You may address me. I will inform him.
RAIDEN: Is this why you chose not to save your family and clan? To maintain your place at his feet?
SCORPION: Do not talk of my family, Raiden!
RAIDEN: Fetch your master, Scorpion. I must speak with him.
SCORPION: You speak only with me.
RAIDEN: Now, Scorpion. Fetch your master.
QUAN CHI: You seek an audience.
RAIDEN: I seek cooperation. Between Earthrealm and the Netherrealm.
QUAN CHI: Losing the battle, are you?
RAIDEN: We will prevail. But with the Netherrealm fighting at our side--
QUAN CHI: You lie poorly, Raiden. Earthrealm's defenses are overwhelmed. You have mere hours.
RAIDEN: ...Name your terms.
QUAN CHI: What do you offer?
RAIDEN: I offer... I offer the souls of Earthrealm warriors who die in this conflict.
RAIDEN: They would agree.
QUAN CHI: You are cavalier with other men's souls.
RAIDEN: Not just others! I offer my own soul as well. If I die, you will have it.
QUAN CHI: How noble, Raiden. Yet utterly pointless.
RAIDEN: No!
QUAN CHI: You see, their souls are already mine. Shao Kahn's payment for Netherrealm's allegiance.
RAIDEN: No! This was not meant to be!
QUAN CHI: Earthrealm has lost, Raiden. Now so shall you. Finish him.
JAX: As you command, my master.
RAIDEN: May the Elder Gods watch over you.
QUAN CHI: The Elder Gods cannot help them. Their souls are mine. Kitana. Nightwolf. Kung Lao.
KITANA: You sealed our fate in this place, Thunder God. You have condemned us all.
RAIDEN: Curse you, Quan Chi.
QUAN CHI: Shao Kahn's victory is nearly complete. Soon he will arrive in Earthrealm.
RAIDEN: No! The Elder Gods cannot allow it.
QUAN CHI: The Elder Gods are toothless. Your world is near destruction, yet they do not act.
RAIDEN: They must! Only through Mortal Kombat may Shao Kahn merge the realms. Lest he face the judgment of the Elder Gods...
RAIDEN: ...Lest he face the judgment of the Elder Gods! He must win!
QUAN CHI: It is you who face judgment, Raiden.
RAIDEN: Thank you, Quan Chi. I now know what must be done.
LIU KANG: Back from the Netherrealm empty-handed, I see.
RAIDEN: Liu Kang! Liu Kang, I now realise what we must do. We must allow Shao Kahn to merge the realms!
LIU KANG: That is insane!
RAIDEN: The Elder Gods forbid it without victory in Mortal Kombat. When he does, the Elder Gods' fury will fall upon him.
RAIDEN: Defeating Shao Kahn before the merge is but temporary. He will return, bringing Armageddon. I have foreseen it!
LIU KANG: Enough, Raiden!
LIU KANG: He is here.
RAIDEN: No! Do as I say! Have faith in the Elder Gods. 
RAIDEN: Have faith in me.
RAIDEN: Liu Kang, I cannot let you fight Shao Kahn!
LIU KANG: Then you are my enemy!
RAIDEN: Liu Kang, do not interfere!
RAIDEN: Liu Kang, stop!
JOHNNY CAGE: Liu Kang! Raiden! No!
LIU KANG: Enough of your madness! If you must die, so be it!
RAIDEN: By the gods, NO!!
RAIDEN: No. This was not meant to happen.
JOHNNY CAGE: What did you do?!
RAIDEN: Liu Kang, forgive me...
LIU KANG: You... have killed us... all...
SONYA: C'mon! It's up to us!
SHAO KAHN: Ah, Raiden. You have come to your senses.
RAIDEN: Earthrealm's citizens suffer. Further resistance serves no purpose.
SHAO KAHN: All these ages you have fought me. You denied me my rightful claim. Not this time.
SHAO KAHN: The Elder Gods fear me now!
SHAO KAHN: Their pathetic Mortal Kombat shackles me no longer!
SHAO KAHN: They masquerade as dragons, but are mere toothless worms.
SHAO KAHN: I know you can feel it. It is the end of all things.
RAIDEN: Elder Gods, where are you? Why do you forsake me?
SHAO KAHN: Your time has passed.
SHAO KAHN: Ages wasted in foolish resistance.
SHAO KAHN: I have won.
RAIDEN: Yes... you have won.
SHAO KAHN: Now, Raiden. Your world ends.
RAIDEN: You violate our will, Shao Kahn. You merge realms without victory in Mortal Kombat. Our penalty is clear.
SHAO KAHN: An anemic effort from ineffecualt deities. Today, I become THE Elder God!
RAIDEN: It is over.
RAIDEN: But only at the gravest of costs.
RAIDEN: So many are gone. Their light has sunk into the earth. I am responsible for their loss.
SONYA: You did what you had to. To protect Earthrealm. Losses in war... are... are inevitable.
RAIDEN: Come. Let us tend the fallen. Then we must help our realm rebuild. Our work has only just begun.
QUAN CHI: Your plan worked to perfection, Lord Shinnok.
SHINNOK: Shao Kahn was blinded by rage. How easily was he convinced that the Elder Gods would ignore his merging the realms.
QUAN CHI: Yet the Thunder God still lives.
SHINNOK: No matter. Neither Earthrealm nor Outworld can now withstand the Netherrealm's onslaught. It is time. Soon I will be free. Earthrealm and Outworld will be ours.
