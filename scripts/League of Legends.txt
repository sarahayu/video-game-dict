Irelia: Sound effect.
Ahri: "Welcome to the Twisted Treeline!"

Ahri: "I just can't even."
Nasus: "Mortals are not meant to rule."
Nasus: Nasus grunts.
Akshan: "That was very clever. I hope it was worth your life."

Garen: "There is no safe harbor from the hand of god."
Ahri: Ahri laughs.
Ashe: "Taking the shot."
Akshan: "Curse this nagging conscience of mine."
Ahri: "Aww! those cute little minions hit the rift in like thirty seconds."
Aatrox: "Ornn, like all gods, you disappoint!"
Ahri: "Ugh. Like chasing your own tails..."

Darius: "Hey, Maokai, I know a court you might've been related to!"
Lux: Lux exhales.
Ashe: "AVAROSA, how much longer will this match go on?"
Ashe: "For the Freljord!"
Lux: "The celestial court- mewling deities swaddled in the tattered fabric of space-time, cowering from annihilation's embrace."
Vayne: "All technology has a dark side."
Jhin: "My stage is the endless abyss."
Jhin: "Every element must be in place."
Lux: "Shielded by light!"
Lux: "Just like going to sleep."
Jhin: "Oh, don't worry, I'll make sure you see everything you wish to see."
Mordekaiser: "Death cannot hold me."
Ashe: "The bigger they are... "
Ahri: "That was amaze-balls!"
Lux: "The cosmic court shines brighter."
Darius: "Too easy!"
Aatrox: "Sorrow... I shall deliver it to you."
Aatrox: "Pantheon, I see you! Like a lamprey you attach yourself to a host! I will carve you from this mortal's form, and eviscerate you both!"
Garen: "Never forget why we fight!"
Darius: "I won't submit to the mandates of tyrants!"
Ahri: "Kiko Spirit Dash!"
Lux: "Water seeks its own level."
Darius: "My destination is clear."
Jhin: "You are mediocrity. My genius will supplant you."
Irelia: "Okay, I'm warmed up."
Ashe: "Hmph. The cold does not forgive."
Darius: "Carve a path."
Lux: "The court creates. The dark consumes."
Ashe: "Don't you move an inch!"
Irelia: "Stop their retreat!"
Darius: "A feast for the wolves."
Mordekaiser: I am in control.
Jhin: "The final fated moment before the curtain falls."
Lux: "Dreams become nightmares."
Aatrox: "I brought you the one true gift, I brought you... death!"
Lux: "Better bundle up."
Lux: "All shall fall before the dark queen!"
Jhin: "Heh... hehe... that hat is ridiculous, now... who let you wear that horrible thing?"
Mordekaiser: Project built me for the city's security. The greatest threat to security is the city.
Irelia: "Leave this land!"
Lux: "I've been hiding my light long enough."
Ahri: "Awesomesauce!"
Nasus: "Anthropomancy: divination by entrails."
Cho'Gath: "For the darkness!"
Lux: "I had always feared the whispers of darkness, but now I can hear it clearly... and it heralds my name."
Jhin: "Eternity, molded by my hands"
Lux: "It's important to stay grounded."
Irelia: "Care to dance?"

Garen: "Demacia..."
Lux: "Sorry, but you got me steamed."
Lux: "You'll regret this."
Nasus: "Redemption is a hollow wish."
Ashe: "Atone!"
Darius: "The tyrant-king has come to die, let's give him what he wants!"
Mordekaiser: Threat identified.
Kindred: "This will hurt - lots!"
Ahri: "Welcome to the Twisted Treeline! Spooky."

Lux: "You brought the sun to a light fight?! That... was... probably a good choice, actually... "
Akshan: "You know you had the coming, right?"
Ahri: "It's hard to be humble when you've got this much sparkle!"
Jhin: "We are alone now, the stars and I."
Ashe: "Humanity isn't a defect."
Lux: "Thoughts are like water, shallow or deep"
Akshan: "Ha ha! Their eyes cannot find me."
Aatrox: "The true sound of my blade can only be heard when they loathe re-incarnation."
Ahri:  Kiko chirps.
Irelia: "Give me your all! I swear it will not be wasted!"
Ashe: "I can do this all day."
Darius: Darius laughs.
Lux: "Natural selection at work."
Ashe: "Multiple targets engaged!"

Lux: "Sleeping is waking, and waking sleep!"
Ahri: "Forget everything."
Cassiopeia: Cassiopeia laughs.
Darius: "My house!"
Jhin: "I was paid to put on a killer show."
Ahri: Sound effect
Irelia: "Time to bail out!"
Lux: "Eons have passed since the court stood together; the rise of the Dark Star hastens our reunion."
Lux: "Creation stands against you."
Cho'Gath: "Ah-Haaa!"
Mordekaiser: My conclusions are the only truth.
Ahri: "Thirty seconds until this party starts."
Garen: Garen laughs

Jhin: "My pattern will flow from your emptiness!"
Kindred: "What do all stories have in common, dear Wolf?"
Ashe: "What devilry!"
Ashe: "Pardon me for any acts of… divine retribution."
Garen: "My throne calls to me, wait for my return."
Ahri: "Come on and fight like a girl!"
Aatrox: "Now, hear the silence of annihilation!"
Lux: "Metal armor, weapons, skin. What did you expect?"
Lux: "Tomorrow is a twinkle, but today is a shining promise."
Darius: "So they sent the magic statue, Demacia must be desperate."
Ahri: "That was totally worth it!"
Aatrox: Aatrox roars.
Lux: "Scorch!"
Akali: "This must be done!"
Lux: "I move in mysterious ways."
Jhin: "Right. On. Cue."
Akshan: "Is it wrong to kill killers? Eh, I'll ponder that later."
Akali: "It's not the killing I'm about, it's the cause."
Akali: "Don't waste the anger, channel it."
Jhin: "Center stage!"
Darius: "Dat fail."

Sett: "Only one of us is leavin'."
Alistar: "GG!"
Kindred: "Not that it will help."

Kindred: "Never one... "
Kindred: "Come, Sion, let us end this mockery."
Darius: "One more for the chopping block."
Mordekaiser: Outcasts are considered an unsafe element, Sylas. You must be destroyed.

Kindred: "They know we'll come."
Lux: "I'm truly sorry it's come to this."
Ashe: "Come back from the shadows."
Mordekaiser: "Cherish the respite."
Mordekaiser: Yi. You caught a glimpse of something man was not meant to see.
Lux: "The universe could use some more darkness."
Ashe: "Another complete waffle on behalf of the bounty hunting indus qtry."
Nasus: "So eager to find meaning in nothingness."
Garen: "I stand for Demacia!"
Lux: "Safe!"

Cho'Gath: "Returning to docking station."
Vayne: "No escape."
Akali: "Everyone dies, I just speed things up."
Ahri: "Whoops."
Mordekaiser: Your mind contains data on an old ally. Who is this wolf-bitten warrior?

Vayne: "I am not a malfunction."
Irelia: "Tyrant!"
Nasus: "This is the way your world ends."

Akali: "Don't hold back!"
Darius: "Everyone around me is moving in slow motion."
Akali: "The will comes from within, not from the blade."

Lux: "You're grounded."
Irelia: "Give all and the spirit gives back!"
Ahri: "I don't want to think about the past. Or the future."
Darius: "No one will be spared from the carnage, brother. Not even you."
